# 3SF Repository Overview

This repo curates the **3-in-3 SDLC Framework (3SF)** knowledge base — a relationship-aware delivery operating system that aligns Client, Vendor, and Product to keep engagement, delivery, and value evolving together.

`src/index.md` contains the high-level guide to 3SF, including the onboarding checklist and navigation map for theory, practice, governance, and diagnostics.
`src/000-intro`, `100-theory`, `200-practice`, `300-contracts`, and `400-training` hold focused modules covering roles, principles, applied tools, contractual patterns, and enablement assets that bring the framework to life.

Use these materials to understand the shared context, agreements, and maturity mechanics that power 3SF across complex client-vendor ecosystems.
