# 3-in-3 Model

## The 3-in-3 Model

The **3-in-3 Model** defines the entire delivery ecosystem as a system of three entities — **Client**, **Vendor (Team)**, and **Product / Service** — connected by three relationships: **Engagement**, **Delivery**, and **Value**.


```
      Product | Service
             / ^
            /   \
     Value /     \ Delivery
          /       \
         /         \
        /           \
       v             \
  Client <----------> Vendor (Team)
          Engagement
```


Each side of the triangle represents a vital relationship that must evolve for sustained delivery success.<br/>
When any side becomes weak or unbalanced, the system loses integrity — resulting in friction, rework, or loss of trust.

## The Three Relationship Lines

### 1. Engagement — *Client ↔ Vendor*

Defines the **working relationship and trust** between those who need the solution and those who build it.<br/>
It determines how decisions are made, how transparency is maintained, and how collaboration scales.

Healthy Engagement enables:

- Shared understanding of goals and constraints.
- Clear governance, communication cadence, and risk ownership.
- Trust that empowers autonomy and reduces friction.

When weak:

- Misaligned expectations or conflicting priorities.
- Reactive communication, scope disputes, and politics.
- “Us vs Them” behavior that blocks collaboration.

### 2. Delivery — *Vendor ↔ Product / Service*

Defines the **execution system** that transforms ideas into working outcomes.<br/>
It represents the vendor team’s capability, flow, and technical integrity.

Healthy Delivery enables:

- Predictable progress and measurable quality.
- Architecture and engineering aligned with product intent.
- Continuous feedback between design, build, and validation.

When weak:

- Over- or under-engineering due to unclear direction.
- Hand-offs that break accountability.
- Quality or automation gaps that erode trust.

### 3. Value — *Product / Service ↔ Client*

Defines the **outcome connection** — how the work contributes to business goals and user needs.

Healthy Value enables:

- Clear problem–solution alignment.
- Defined success metrics and value validation.
- Regular learning loops between users, client, and team.

When weak:

- Delivered features without measurable outcomes.
- Lack of user validation or impact tracking.
- Value assumptions never revisited post-release.

## The 3-in-3 Dynamic

The triangle functions as **a system of balance and tension**:

- **Engagement** builds alignment and trust.
- **Delivery** ensures capability and flow.
- **Value** validates outcomes and relevance.

When one side strengthens, the others benefit:

- Strong Engagement improves Delivery coordination.
- Reliable Delivery builds confidence and strengthens Engagement.
- Proven Value reinforces both partnership and autonomy.

3SF ensures that every decision across the SDLC protects this systemic equilibrium.

## When the Triangle Collapses

If any relationship line weakens, the 3-in-3 system contracts — often reverting to a transactional pattern.<br/>
For example, when the **Value** connection breaks (no client product ownership or user insight), Delivery continues but meaning is lost.<br/>
When **Engagement** fails, trust erodes and coordination turns contractual.<br/>
These imbalances signal a system collapse, not a team failure — recovery begins by restoring the missing relationship, not by adding more process.

## Summary

The **3-in-3 Model** represents *what the system is*:<br/>
a triangle of **Client**, **Vendor**, and **Product** connected through **Engagement**, **Delivery**, and **Value** lines.
