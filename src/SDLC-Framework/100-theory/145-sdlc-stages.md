## SDLC Stages

### Overview

The **3SF SDLC Stages** define the full flow of software product delivery as a **continuous system of understanding, creation, validation, and improvement**.<br/>
They describe *how value moves through the system* — from the first discovery of a problem to the ongoing evolution of the solution.

Each stage represents a distinct purpose but connects through feedback loops, ensuring learning never stops and every delivery cycle strengthens both product and partnership maturity.

### The Seven SDLC Stages

| **Stage** | **Purpose** | **Outcome** |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Discover** | Understand the problem, align on goals, and explore solution directions with stakeholders. | A validated understanding of the problem space and desired outcomes. |
| **Shape** | Define the product scope, architecture vision, and delivery feasibility based on real constraints. | A feasible and outcome-aligned delivery plan with known assumptions and trade-offs. |
| **Build** | Design, develop, and integrate software components with automation and quality at the core. | A working, testable product increment that demonstrates tangible progress and reliability. |
| **Validate** | Test functionality, performance, usability, and security to ensure the solution meets expectations. | Verified confidence that the product delivers the intended experience and quality. |
| **Release** | Package, approve, and deploy the solution for users through reliable and repeatable pipelines. | A stable release available to users with traceable approvals and predictable deployment. |
| **Run** | Monitor and support the live system, ensuring reliability, scalability, and fast issue resolution. | Reliable operations, user satisfaction, and data-driven visibility of system health. |
| **Evolve** | Learn from outcomes and feedback to continuously improve product, process, and team effectiveness. | Actionable insights leading to better products, stronger relationships, and organizational learning. |

### SDLC as a System of Flow and Learning

The stages form an *adaptive flow* of intent, delivery, and feedback:

`Discover → Shape → Build → Validate → Release → Run → Evolve ↺`

- **Discover & Shape** establish clarity and feasibility before investment.
- **Build, Validate, and Release** create and deliver tangible value.
- **Run & Evolve** close the learning loop, informing future discovery.

Each iteration through the loop increases **delivery maturity** and **relationship trust**, evolving both the system and the collaboration that sustains it.

### Relationship-Aware SDLC

Each SDLC stage also represents a **relationship checkpoint** between Client and Vendor — defining how shared responsibility matures as delivery progresses.

| **Stage** | **Relationship Focus** | **Shared Ownership Example** |
|------------|------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Discover** | Transparency and alignment on problem space. | Joint definition of goals, assumptions, and success criteria. |
| **Shape** | Trust and outcome-based planning. | Co-design of roadmap, architecture, and estimation. |
| **Build** | Autonomy and visibility in execution. | Shared sprint reviews and delivery metrics. |
| **Validate** | Confidence and mutual accountability. | Joint acceptance and performance evaluation. |
| **Release** | Predictable and transparent delivery. | Shared approval and communication to users. |
| **Run** | Stability and operational trust. | Shared monitoring dashboards and escalation paths. |
| **Evolve** | Partnership and learning continuity. | Joint retrospectives and improvement backlogs. |

Relationship maturity increases as both organizations learn to rely on one another for clarity, delivery, and learning — turning the SDLC into a **partnership growth mechanism**, not just a technical lifecycle.

### Flow Characteristics Across the SDLC

| **Characteristic** | **Early Phases (Discover–Shape)** | **Middle Phases (Build–Validate–Release)** | **Late Phases (Run–Evolve)** |
|---------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Focus** | Alignment and feasibility | Execution and verification | Continuity and learning |
| **Feedback Loops** | Qualitative (people, intent) | Quantitative (metrics, performance) | Systemic (value, outcome) |
| **Risk Profile** | High uncertainty | Managed risk | Controlled adaptation |
| **Leadership Mode** | Facilitative and consultative | Operational and technical | Strategic and reflective |
| **Ownership Distribution** | Client-driven collaboration | Vendor-led autonomy | Shared strategic renewal |

### Run vs Evolve: Stability vs Learning

In many organizations, the **Run** phase is mistaken for the end of delivery — focused purely on uptime, cost control, and SLA adherence.<br/>
While stability is vital, stopping there creates a **false plateau of success** where no new learning enters the system.

The **Evolve** phase exists to prevent that stagnation.<br/>
Its metrics differ from Run:

- *Run* measures reliability (uptime, MTTR, operational cost).
- *Evolve* measures adaptability (validated learning, feature adoption, customer feedback integration).

When evolution is skipped, operational excellence turns brittle — systems stay available but stop improving.<br/>
A mature delivery culture measures both: **Run for stability, Evolve for growth**.

### Using the SDLC Stages

The SDLC Stages act as a **map, not a prescription**.<br/>
Each project can emphasize different stages depending on context — for example:

- In R&D or early product discovery, *Discover* and *Shape* dominate.
- In modernization or migration work, *Build*, *Validate*, and *Release* take the lead.
- In product sustainment, *Run* and *Evolve* become the main engines of improvement.

3SF’s value lies in enabling **conscious adaptation** — choosing how deep each stage goes based on commercial, organizational, and technical realities.

### Summary

- The SDLC Stages define **how value flows** through seven interconnected phases.
- Each stage contributes both to **delivery outcomes** and **relationship maturity**.
- 3SF turns the SDLC into a **system of alignment, flow, and feedback** — ensuring that what we build is valuable, feasible, and continuously improving.
