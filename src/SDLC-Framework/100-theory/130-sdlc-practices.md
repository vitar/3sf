# SDLC Practices

## Overview

The **SDLC Practices** represent six cross-cutting disciplines that sustain quality, predictability, and learning throughout all stages of delivery.<br/>
Each practice complements the others — forming the behavioral and technical foundation of a reliable delivery system.

These practices act as the *horizontal layer* of the 3SF — spanning all SDLC Stages (Discover → Evolve) to ensure alignment, quality, and continuous improvement.

## The Six SDLC Practices

| **Practice** | **Definition** | **Core Focus** |
|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Product Thinking** | We co-create clarity and direction with clients by defining goals, value, and outcomes before committing to delivery. | Shared understanding of *why* we build. |
| **Architecture & Design** | We shape scalable, secure, and adaptable solutions by aligning technical design with product intent and constraints. | Fit-for-purpose design and feasibility. |
| **Engineering & Quality** | We build maintainable, high-quality software through craftsmanship, automation, and shared responsibility. | Consistency, reliability, and craftsmanship. |
| **DevOps & Delivery** | We enable fast, safe, and repeatable delivery by integrating automation, environments, and monitoring from day one. | Speed and stability through automation and visibility. |
| **Governance & Risk** | We manage complexity and protect value by embedding compliance, security, and accountability into every step. | Transparency, predictability, and responsibility. |
| **Feedback & Learning** | We continuously improve by listening to signals from users, systems, and teams — turning insight into better outcomes. | Growth, reflection, and adaptability. |

## Practices as the Delivery Backbone

These practices work across all SDLC Stages — ensuring continuity from discovery to sustainment.<br/>
They **stabilize delivery flow** by balancing speed, quality, and adaptability.

- **Product Thinking** brings clarity of purpose.
- **Architecture & Design** ensures technical feasibility.
- **Engineering & Quality** secures craftsmanship and maintainability.
- **DevOps & Delivery** provides automation and reliability.
- **Governance & Risk** maintains control without bureaucracy.
- **Feedback & Learning** closes loops between product, people, and outcomes.

Together, they form the **delivery backbone** of 3SF — connecting intent (why), structure (how), and learning (what next).

## Practices Across SDLC Stages

Each SDLC Practice manifests differently depending on the stage of delivery.<br/>
The table below shows how every practice supports the system throughout its flow.

| **Stage →** | **Discover** | **Shape** | **Build** | **Validate** | **Release** | **Run** | **Evolve** |
|--------------|--------------|------------|------------|---------------|--------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Product Thinking** | Define goals, outcomes, and user needs. | Align scope and priorities with value. | Keep user outcomes visible during development. | Validate value and user satisfaction. | Communicate impact to stakeholders. | Monitor usage and adoption. | Reframe opportunities from insights. |
| **Architecture & Design** | Explore high-level approaches and constraints. | Define architecture vision and feasibility. | Implement patterns and integrations. | Validate non-functional requirements. | Harden deployment architecture. | Ensure scalability and reliability. | Modernize design and stack. |
| **Engineering & Quality** | Evaluate feasibility and risks. | Prepare automation and QA strategy. | Build with test coverage and code quality. | Run functional and security tests. | Stabilize and fix regressions. | Handle incidents and performance. | Improve maintainability and refactor. |
| **DevOps & Delivery** | Define automation vision and environments. | Configure pipelines and CI/CD baselines. | Automate builds and integration. | Integrate testing and staging. | Execute deployments and rollback. | Monitor infrastructure and uptime. | Evolve pipelines and observability. |
| **Governance & Risk** | Define governance and decision cadence. | Validate feasibility vs. budget and compliance. | Track progress and scope change. | Ensure acceptance and compliance sign-offs. | Control approvals and audits. | Manage SLA and operational risks. | Integrate governance learnings. |
| **Feedback & Learning** | Capture assumptions and unknowns. | Validate feasibility and stakeholder feedback. | Collect delivery metrics for improvement. | Measure outcomes and quality. | Gather user feedback post-release. | Analyze incidents and usage data. | Feed learning into discovery and training. |

This table visualizes how practices **connect horizontally** across the lifecycle, while SDLC Stages define the **vertical flow** of value.<br/>
Mature systems maintain consistency of these practices even when the project emphasis shifts between stages.

## Practice Interdependence

No single practice guarantees success; the system works when all are balanced:

| **When practice X is weak...** | **Resulting system effect** |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Product Thinking | Misaligned priorities, wasted effort. |
| Architecture & Design | Fragile or over-engineered solutions. |
| Engineering & Quality | Unpredictable releases, rework cycles. |
| DevOps & Delivery | Manual bottlenecks, low feedback speed. |
| Governance & Risk | Unclear accountability, unmanaged debt. |
| Feedback & Learning | Stagnation and repeated mistakes. |

A mature team develops *healthy tension* among practices — trading off intentionally instead of neglecting one dimension.

## Practices as a Foundation for Maturity

As projects evolve, each practice demonstrates maturity through visible behaviors:

| **Practice** | **Early Maturity Behavior** | **Advanced Maturity Behavior** |
|---------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Product Thinking** | Feature focus, limited validation. | Outcome focus, evidence-based decisions. |
| **Architecture & Design** | Ad-hoc patterns, reactive fixes. | Intentional evolution, transparent trade-offs. |
| **Engineering & Quality** | Manual testing, quality owned by QA. | Shared quality ownership, automation first. |
| **DevOps & Delivery** | Manual deployments, unstable environments. | Full CI/CD automation, continuous observability. |
| **Governance & Risk** | Escalation-based control, unclear roles. | Embedded governance, proactive risk sharing. |
| **Feedback & Learning** | Occasional retrospectives. | Continuous data-driven learning loops. |

These behaviors become inputs to the **RAC** and **CRC**, ensuring maturity assessments reflect *system reality* — not just process compliance.

## Summary

- SDLC Practices are the **operating disciplines** that make each stage reliable and adaptive.
- The **Stages–Practices Matrix** shows how these disciplines interact through the lifecycle, ensuring flow and stability.
- Balanced practices ensure that progress is **fast, visible, and sustainable**.
- Together, they form the continuous backbone of the **3SF delivery system**, enabling predictable execution and continuous learning.
