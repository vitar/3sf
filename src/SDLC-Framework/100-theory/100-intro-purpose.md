# 3-in-3 SDLC Framework (3SF)

## Introduction

The **3-in-3 SDLC Framework** — or **3SF** — is a relationship-aware software delivery framework that unites **Client**, **Vendor**, and **Product / Service** into one coherent system of collaboration.<br/>
It helps organizations design, execute, and evolve delivery systems that are **aligned, predictable, and continuously learning**, regardless of project type or commercial model.

Where most delivery frameworks describe *what happens inside a vendor organization*, 3SF explains **how success depends on the relationships between all three system elements** — *Client ↔ Vendor ↔ Product* — and how alignment across them determines value realization.

## Purpose

The 3SF was designed to:

- **Connect strategy and delivery** by translating goals, constraints, and context into practical delivery configurations.
- **Expose and close maturity gaps** between Client and Vendor through shared understanding of responsibilities and decision-making.
- **Balance structure and adaptability** — combining predictable delivery with continuous learning and feedback.
- **Enable contextual decision-making** — showing how commercial, organizational, and technical drivers shape the right delivery approach.
- **Build partnership maturity** over time, turning transactional engagements into strategic collaborations.

3SF serves simultaneously as:

1. **A delivery-system design framework** — guiding how to configure projects before execution.
2. **A diagnostic and learning tool** — helping leaders assess delivery health and identify systemic improvements.
3. **A maturity model** — supporting continuous evolution of trust and accountability.

## Core Idea

Every delivery system operates within a **triangle of relationships**:

```
          Product | Service
                 / ^
                /   \
         Value /     \ Delivery
              /       \
             /         \
            /           \
           v             \
      Client <----------> Vendor (Team)
              Engagement
```

Each side of this triangle represents a **relationship line**:

- **Engagement (Client ↔ Vendor):** defines collaboration and trust.
- **Delivery (Vendor ↔ Product):** defines execution and quality.
- **Value (Product ↔ Client):** defines outcomes and impact.

Healthy delivery emerges only when all three sides evolve together.

## Framework Overview

The **3-in-3 SDLC Framework (3SF)** is organized into **interconnected systemic layers** that together form one continuous system of alignment, flow, and learning — connecting **strategy → execution → collaboration → maturity**.

| **#** | **Layer** | **Purpose** |
|:--:|:--|:--|
| **1** | **[Vision, Principles & Beliefs](105-vision-principles-beliefs.md)** | Establish the *mindset foundation* — the shared philosophy and guiding values behind 3SF. |
| **2** | **[3-in-3 Model](110-3in3-model.md) & [Relationship Maturity](115-3in3-model-maturity.md)** | Define the structural ecosystem — how Client, Vendor, and Product interact and evolve through the maturity path. |
| **3** | **Rules of Governance: [Contextual Drivers Layer](120-contextual-drivers-layer.md) and [Stable Rules Layer](125-stable-rules-layer.md)** | Describe the contextual drivers and stable rules that maintain coherence, adaptability, and systemic balance. |
| **4** | **[Rule Audit Checklist (RAC)](130-rule-audit-checklist.md)** | Provide a structured way to evaluate delivery health, rule adherence, and improvement priorities. |
| **5** | **[Contextual Rules Catalog (CRC)](135-contextual-rules-catalog.md)** | Translate the framework into actionable playbooks for specific delivery contexts (e.g., Fixed-Bid, Co-Delivery, Continuous Evolution). |
| **6** | **[Practice Setup & Tools](../200-practice/200-practice-architecture.md)** | Explain how to apply 3SF in real projects — using High-Impact Contracts, Execution Tools, and Diagnostics. |
| **7** | **[Maturity Integration Layer](../300-contracts/300-contracts-architecture.md)** | Connects all other layers through feedback and learning, ensuring relationship growth and delivery resilience. |

## Evolution

3SF evolved from repeated real-world observations where delivery success or failure rarely came from technical complexity but from **misaligned expectations, ownership gaps, and systemic friction** between Client and Vendor.

It emerged as a **unifying model** — connecting strategic, operational, and adaptive layers into one ecosystem of delivery understanding.

## Resilience by Design

3SF recognizes that delivery systems often fail not from poor execution but from **systemic resistance** — competing incentives, unclear accountability, or organizational inertia.

It is intentionally designed to be *anti-fragile*:

- **Contextual Drivers Layer (CDL)** and **Stable Rules Layer (SRL)** identify and stabilize environmental forces.
- **Rule Audit Checklist (RAC)** detects friction before it escalates to failure.
- **Maturity Layer** ensures trust and accountability evolve together with process maturity.
- **Learning loops** convert mistakes into insight — making the system smarter with every iteration.

3SF doesn’t eliminate risk — it **makes risk visible, discussable, and manageable** across both Client and Vendor organizations.

## When to Use 3SF

| **Use Case** | **Typical Goal** |
|:--|:--|
| **Before a project starts** | Design the right delivery system based on context and commercial model. |
| **During delivery** | Diagnose bottlenecks and maturity gaps using CDL, SRL, and RAC. |
| **After release** | Guide retrospectives and continuous improvement across projects. |
| **For leadership development** | Teach systemic thinking and contextual decision-making. |

## Benefits

- **Clarity:** Shared language across Client, Vendor, and leadership.
- **Alignment:** Connected view of strategy, delivery, and value realization.
- **Predictability:** Systematic handling of uncertainty and governance.
- **Learning:** Built-in feedback loops to prevent repeated failures.
- **Scalability:** Works for individual projects or enterprise portfolios.

## Reading Structure

The Theory section introduces 3SF from **philosophy to application**, following this order:

1. **[Vision, Principles & Beliefs](105-vision-principles-beliefs.md)** → *Mindset Foundation* — why the framework exists.
2. **[3-in-3 Model](110-3in3-model.md) & [Relationship Maturity](115-3in3-model-maturity.md)** → *Systemic Foundation* — how the system connects.
3. **Rules of Governance ([CDL](120-contextual-drivers-layer.md) + [SRL](125-stable-rules-layer.md))** → the bridge that maintains coherence and adaptability.
4. **[RAC](130-rule-audit-checklist.md) + [CRC](135-contextual-rules-catalog.md)** → methods and contextual playbooks to assess and apply the rules.
5. **[Practice Setup & Tools](../200-practice/200-practice-architecture.md)** → applying 3SF in real delivery contexts through High-Impact Contracts, Execution Tools, and Diagnostics.
6. **[Maturity Integration Layer](../300-contracts/300-contracts-architecture.md)** → ensures learning and partnership growth across all layers.

## Summary

> **3SF connects delivery design with relationship maturity — aligning structure, behavior, and learning into a single, adaptive system.**

3SF is not a methodology; it is a **meta-framework** that ensures any methodology fits its context, maintains coherence under change, and deepens trust between organizations.
