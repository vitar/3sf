## SDLC Stage Dimensions – Discover

### Purpose

The **Discover Stage** establishes the foundation for the entire delivery system.<br/>
Its goal is to **understand the problem**, align stakeholders on goals, and explore possible solution directions before committing to execution.

Discovery defines *what success means*, *for whom*, and *why*.<br/>
It transforms assumptions into shared understanding — reducing uncertainty, building trust, and shaping realistic next-stage decisions (Shape, Build).

When done well, Discover prevents most downstream delivery issues: unclear scope, missing validation, misaligned expectations, and low confidence in estimates.

### Core Outcomes

| **Outcome** | **Description** |
|--------------|-----------------|
| **Clarity of Purpose** | A shared understanding of the problem, goals, and expected value. |
| **Context Map** | Documented business, user, and technical context (constraints, systems, dependencies). |
| **Validated Assumptions** | Key unknowns identified and tested via interviews, prototypes, or data. |
| **Discovery Artifacts** | Early deliverables such as user journeys, high-level architecture options, and estimation boundaries. |
| **Stakeholder Alignment** | Agreement on next steps, ownership, and engagement model for the Shape stage. |

### Discovery Dimensions

#### 1. Strategic Alignment

Defines how well the problem and goals are understood and connected to business outcomes.

| **Aspect** | **Low Maturity (Reactive)** | **High Maturity (Proactive)** |
|-------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Problem Definition** | Vague, solution-driven (“we need an app”). | Clearly defined, measurable business problem. |
| **Goal Alignment** | Conflicting stakeholder objectives. | Shared outcomes defined in measurable terms. |
| **Value Hypothesis** | Assumed benefits, no validation. | Explicit value model with metrics and dependencies. |
| **User Understanding** | Minimal or second-hand knowledge. | Direct discovery with users, empathy-based insights. |

**Improvement Strategies**

- Use *Product Thinking* workshops to define outcomes and KPIs.
- Apply *Value Mapping* and *Wardley Mapping* to connect goals and capabilities.
- Ensure goals are validated with both business and delivery stakeholders.

#### 2. Planning & Flow

Defines how discovery activities are structured, timeboxed, and prioritized.

| **Aspect** | **Low Maturity** | **High Maturity** |
|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Discovery Approach** | Unstructured discussions or scattered workshops. | Timeboxed discovery plan with clear goals and outputs. |
| **Work Sequencing** | Parallel ideation without validation. | Incremental exploration: learn → converge → define. |
| **Estimation Readiness** | Estimation done without validated scope. | Feasibility and complexity assessed through validated artifacts. |
| **Decision Cadence** | Decisions deferred or made ad hoc. | Defined checkpoints with documented assumptions. |

**Improvement Strategies**

- Apply *Double Diamond* or *Dual Track* discovery frameworks.
- Visualize discovery backlog and outcomes (e.g., Notion, Miro, Jira).
- Include estimation boundaries early — treat estimates as hypotheses.

#### 3. Collaboration & Communication

Defines how teams, clients, and stakeholders interact to co-create understanding.

| **Aspect** | **Low Maturity** | **High Maturity** |
|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Stakeholder Engagement** | Sporadic meetings, information silos. | Inclusive workshops, active participation from both sides. |
| **Roles & Responsibility** | Undefined — discovery “owned” by one party. | Shared accountability between Client and Vendor teams. |
| **Communication Cadence** | Irregular, reactive. | Scheduled sessions with outcomes shared transparently. |
| **Decision Logging** | Verbal agreements only. | Structured documentation (decisions, rationale, next actions). |

**Improvement Strategies**

- Establish *Engagement Agreement* — define discovery ownership, cadence, tools.
- Use a shared *Decision Log* or *Discovery Journal*.
- Align technical and product language — reduce translation gaps.

#### 4. Quality & Risk Management

Defines how uncertainty and validation are handled during exploration.

| **Aspect** | **Low Maturity** | **High Maturity** |
|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Assumption Management** | Risks and unknowns undocumented. | Key assumptions identified, tracked, and tested. |
| **Feasibility Validation** | Technical feasibility assumed or skipped. | Feasibility validated via quick prototypes or proof-of-concept. |
| **Scope Boundaries** | Discovery expands uncontrollably. | Clear timebox and prioritization of discovery goals. |
| **Risk Sharing** | Risks pushed to the next stage. | Risks explicitly shared and mitigation planned jointly. |

**Improvement Strategies**

- Maintain an *Assumptions Board* (risks, evidence, actions).
- Introduce *Rapid Feasibility Tests* (technical spikes, data validation).
- Use a fixed discovery budget with a prioritized scope to maintain focus.

#### 5. Learning & Adaptation

Defines how feedback is captured and turned into better decisions.

| **Aspect** | **Low Maturity** | **High Maturity** |
|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Feedback Loops** | None or informal (“we’ll figure it out later”). | Frequent validation with stakeholders or users. |
| **Knowledge Capture** | Insights lost in meeting notes. | Structured summary: what we learned, what changed. |
| **Retrospective Practice** | Post-discovery review skipped. | Retrospective held to evaluate discovery effectiveness. |
| **Transition Readiness** | Shape starts with unvalidated backlog. | Clear handover including context, validated artifacts, and assumptions. |

**Improvement Strategies**

- Document *Discovery Learnings* with impact level and next-step recommendation.
- Run a short *Discovery Retrospective* before Shape.
- Ensure all findings are summarized in a *Discovery Report* template for reuse.

### Common Failure Modes

| **Failure Mode** | **Root Cause** | **Correction** |
|------------------|----------------|----------------|
| **“We started building too early.”** | Discovery cut short or skipped. | Enforce discovery exit criteria before Shape begins. |
| **“We didn’t know this dependency existed.”** | Missing system or stakeholder mapping. | Include dependency identification as a required discovery artifact. |
| **“The client expected X, but we delivered Y.”** | Goals misaligned or undocumented. | Introduce measurable success metrics and stakeholder review. |
| **“Estimates were way off.”** | Estimation based on unvalidated scope. | Validate assumptions and establish uncertainty range in estimates. |

Over-extending discovery can be as harmful as skipping it — excessive exploration delays learning and erodes stakeholder confidence.

### Measuring Discovery Health

Indicators of a healthy Discovery stage:

| **Signal** | **Description** |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Stakeholders can articulate the same goal in one sentence.** | Alignment and clarity achieved. |
| **All key assumptions are documented and validated or prioritized for testing.** | Systemic thinking established. |
| **Feasibility validated with quick technical or design prototypes.** | Confidence increased for Shape. |
| **Discovery report reviewed and accepted by both Client and Vendor.** | Mutual commitment achieved. |

Quantitative indicators may include:

- % of validated assumptions vs. total identified
- Time spent in Discovery vs. number of unresolved questions
- Confidence score in estimate readiness (self-assessed 1–5 scale)

### Discovery and Relationship Maturity

Discovery is where **Transactional Trust** evolves into **Aligned Autonomy**.<br/>
Transparency, open communication, and early co-ownership set the tone for the entire engagement.

High-maturity discovery:

- Establishes **shared understanding** instead of deliverables only.
- Builds **trust through visibility**, not control.
- Creates **momentum for partnership** before contractual delivery begins.

### Summary

- The **Discover Stage** is about learning, not committing — converting uncertainty into clarity.
- Its five dimensions (Strategic Alignment, Planning & Flow, Collaboration, Quality & Risk, Learning & Adaptation) ensure balanced exploration.
- Discovery maturity is measured by *how well understanding, alignment, and validation are achieved together*.
- A disciplined, collaborative discovery is the single most powerful predictor of downstream delivery success.
