# SECTION IV: GOVERNANCE & DIAGNOSTICS

## 3SF Governance Contracts Architecture

> *“Principles define the intent. Contracts define the commitment.”*

### Purpose

The **3SF Contracts Architecture** defines how the **3-in-3 SDLC Framework (3SF)** principles and practices are **institutionalized through agreements** that govern collaboration between **Client** and **Vendor** organizations.

This section is part of the **Governance & Diagnostics layer** of 3SF — alongside the **Maturity Dashboard** and the **Rule Audit Checklist (RAC) / Contextual Rules Catalog (CRC)**.<br/>
Together, they form the inspection and governance interface between **3SF Theory** and **3SF Practices**.

While **Theory** defines *why* the system exists and **Practice** defines *how* it operates, the **Contracts** define *how both sides commit to those rules in real engagements.*

3SF Contracts turn **alignment and maturity** into **co-signed, inspectable commitments** — making the framework operationally enforceable across organizational boundaries.

### Objectives

- Provide a **map of 3SF contractual instruments** that formalize shared accountability and autonomy.
- Clarify the **relationship between Principles, Practices, and Contracts**.
- Define **how maturity evolves** through progressive contractual agreements.
- Serve as a **reference** for integrating 3SF governance into Statements of Work (SoW), Delivery Charters, or Partnership Agreements.

### Structure of the Contracts Part

Each contract represents a **governance artifact** derived from a 3SF Principle or Practice.<br/>
Contracts are grouped by **system purpose** and **relationship maturity stage**.

| Category | Primary Purpose | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Engagement Contracts** | Define the foundational rules of collaboration, shared terminology, and relationship entry conditions. | [Engagement Contract](310-engagement-contract.md) |
| **Governance Contracts** | Define decision-making rights, escalation rules, and shared accountability. | [Governance Contract](330-governance-contract.md) |
| **Maturity Contracts** | Define trust evolution and autonomy growth milestones. | [Maturity Growth Contract](320-maturity-growth-contract.md) |
| **Evolution Contracts** | Define review, renewal, and transformation rules across project or portfolio lifecycle. | [Relationship Evolution Contract](340-relationship-evolution-contract.md) |
| **Template Attachments** | Provide operational templates for high-impact artifacts (OAM, ATC, ACBC). | [Template: Autonomy & Control Boundary Charter](352-template-autonomy-control.md) |

Each contract type may attach to a **Delivery Charter**, **SoW**, or **Portfolio Governance Framework**, depending on organizational maturity.

### Relationship to Theory and Practice

The **Contracts layer** is the boundary between intent and behavior — it ensures the same maturity language is applied in **legal**, **governance**, and **delivery** conversations.

Within the Governance & Diagnostics layer, **Contracts** operationalize the principles defined in the **Contextual Drivers Layer (CDL)** and **Stable Rules Layer (SRL)**, while the **Maturity Dashboard**, **RAC**, and **CRC** act as the feedback and inspection mechanisms.<br/>
Together they ensure that governance and learning remain synchronized across Client and Vendor organizations.

```

> **Interpretation:**<br/>
> Theory defines intent (Principles, Layers, Maturity).<br/>
> Contracts define boundaries (Agreements, Rights, Commitments).<br/>
> Practices define behavior (Tools, Routines, Artifacts).

### Progressive Contractual Maturity

3SF contracts evolve as **trust and autonomy** increase between organizations.<br/>
Each maturity stage changes what must be *approved*, *co-signed*, or *self-governed.*

| Maturity Level | Contractual Pattern | Decision Autonomy | Typical Artifacts |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Transactional** | Command & Control | Client approves all scope and budget changes. | Baseline SoW, initial [Engagement Contract](310-engagement-contract.md) |
| **Collaborative** | Shared Governance | Vendor adjusts execution within agreed iteration boundaries. | [Governance Contract](330-governance-contract.md) |
| **Co-Creative** | Distributed Accountability | Vendor self-governs backlog and release within outcome targets. | [Maturity Growth Contract](320-maturity-growth-contract.md), [Autonomy & Control Boundary Charter](352-template-autonomy-control.md) |
| **Strategic Partnership** | Joint Steering | Both sides co-manage portfolio roadmap and investment strategy. | [Relationship Evolution Contract](340-relationship-evolution-contract.md) |

### Mapping Principles to Contract Types

| 3SF Principle | Primary Contract | Related Practice Artifacts | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Trust before Control** | [Autonomy & Control Boundary Charter](352-template-autonomy-control.md) | Governance & Risk | Defines how decision-making rights evolve with maturity. |
| **Outcome before Output** | [Outcome-to-Accountability Map](350-template-outcome-accountability.md) | Product Thinking | Establishes measurable value metrics co-owned by Client and Vendor. |
| **Shared Accountability** | [Architectural Trade-Off Contract](351-template-architectural-tradeoff.md) | Architecture & Design | Makes technical risk and quality trade-offs transparent and co-signed. |
| **Flow before Speed** | [Governance Contract](330-governance-contract.md) | DevOps & Delivery | Ensures system flow is prioritized over short-term performance. |
| **Learning before Blame** | [Maturity Growth Contract](320-maturity-growth-contract.md) | Feedback & Learning | Turns retrospectives into learning commitments instead of fault audits. |

### Integration with Practice Layer

Contracts serve as **boundary artifacts** that reference or embed 3SF Practice tools.

| Contract | Embedded Practice Artifacts | Used By | Cadence |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Engagement Contract** | Engagement Context Canvas (ECC), Initial Delivery Design | Client Executive Sponsor / Vendor Account Lead | RFP / Kick-off |
| **Governance Contract** | Autonomy & Control Boundary Charter (ACBC), Flow Constraint Map | Client Governance Officer / Vendor Delivery Lead | Ongoing |
| **Maturity Growth Contract** | Maturity Dashboard, Quarterly Assessment | Account Lead / Executive Sponsor | Quarterly |
| **Relationship Evolution Contract** | Relationship Audit, Portfolio Review | Practice Lead / Engineering Director | Annual |

This ensures 3SF artifacts are **living governance components**, not separate documents.

### Using Contracts in Delivery and Training

The Contracts section is essential for:

- **Procurement teams**, to include maturity and accountability in sourcing models.
- **Client executives**, to structure engagement agreements beyond SLAs.
- **Vendor delivery leaders**, to define the boundaries of autonomy and responsibility.
- **Coaches and trainers**, to teach 3SF as a governance language, not just a delivery model.

In training and onboarding, this file acts as the **starting point** for introducing governance through maturity.

### Summary

The **3SF Contracts Architecture** defines the **governance backbone** of the 3SF Operating System:

- **Theory** establishes intent and principles.
- **Practice** defines methods and tools.
- **Contracts** turn principles and tools into binding commitments.

Together, they enable organizations to **move from transactional projects to strategic partnerships** — not by process enforcement, but through measurable, evolving agreements grounded in shared accountability and trust.
