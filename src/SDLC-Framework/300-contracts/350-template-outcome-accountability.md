# Template – Outcome-to-Accountability Agreement

> *“Every output must trace to a shared outcome, or it serves no one.”*

## Purpose

The **Outcome-to-Accountability Agreement (OAA)** is a **contractual template** derived from the 3SF **Outcome-to-Accountability Map**.<br/>
It formalizes the shared ownership of product or service outcomes between Client and Vendor organizations.

This agreement enforces the 3SF principle **“Outcome before Output”** by making every deliverable accountable to a measurable business result, ensuring that both sides co-own the *impact*, not just the *work*.

The OAA can be attached to Statements of Work, Delivery Charters, or Engagement Contracts as an outcome-governance annex.

## Scope and Application

| Dimension | Scope |
|------------|-------|
| **SDLC Stages** | Discovery → Design → Delivery |
| **3SF Relationship Lines** | Value ↔ Delivery |
| **3SF Layers** | Contextual Drivers Layer (CDL) + Stable Rules Layer (SRL) |
| **Maturity Target** | From *Transactional Trust* → toward *Collaborative Confidence* |

## Contract Parties and Roles

| Role | Representative | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|----------------|
| **Client Product Leader** | [Name, Title] | Defines expected business outcomes and success metrics. |
| **Vendor Product Leader** | [Name, Title] | Aligns delivery scope to business metrics and verifies impact realization. |
| **Executive Sponsor (Client)** | [Name, Title] | Approves overall business alignment and measurable targets. |
| **Account Lead (Vendor)** | [Name, Title] | Ensures contractual commitments support agreed outcomes. |

## Agreement Structure

Each OAA is structured as a set of **Outcome → Output → Accountability** links, where both organizations co-sign their roles and expectations.

| Business Outcome | Supporting Deliverables | Client Accountability | Vendor Responsibility | Verification Method / KPI | Review Frequency |
|------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|----------------------------|------------------|
| Example: Increase online conversion by 5% within 3 months. | Front-end redesign, A/B testing framework. | Defines success metrics and validates business data. | Delivers solution and tracks analytics. | KPI dashboard (conversion %, bounce rate). | Monthly |
| Example: Reduce support ticket volume by 30%. | Improve in-app guidance, chatbot integration. | Provides baseline and post-release data. | Delivers self-service features and monitors adoption. | Ticket analytics, CSAT score. | Quarterly |

Each row represents a **jointly owned success path** — both accountable (Client) and responsible (Vendor).

## Agreement Clauses

### Clause 1 – Shared Ownership of Outcomes

Both parties agree that measurable business outcomes define success.<br/>
Outputs or deliverables are only considered complete when their agreed outcomes have been verified through objective evidence.

### Clause 2 – Definition of Verification Metrics

Metrics are defined jointly before development begins.<br/>
Client provides data sources; Vendor ensures measurement mechanisms exist in the solution.<br/>
All metrics must have:

- A **baseline**,
- A **target**, and
- A **timeframe** for verification.

### Clause 3 – Review and Renewal

The OAA is reviewed during **Quarterly Assessments**.<br/>
If outcomes are not met, corrective actions are defined jointly without assigning blame — guided by the [Learning Before Blame Protocol](../200-practice/275-learning-before-blame-protocol.md).

### Clause 4 – Adjustment Procedure

When business priorities change, outcomes may be updated with approval from both Product Leaders and Account Leads.
Changes must maintain traceability between new outcomes and delivery plans.

### Clause 5 – Transparency and Reporting

Both sides agree to share progress transparently through the **Maturity Dashboard** and **Governance Contract** cadence.
Outcome reports are integrated into portfolio or program-level reviews.

## Inputs / Outputs

| Inputs | Outputs |
|---------|----------|
| Business objectives, backlog, SoW deliverables | **Outcome-to-Accountability Agreement**, baseline metrics, quarterly review reports |

## Metrics / Signals

| Category | Example Indicators |
|-----------|--------------------|
| **Outcome Clarity** | ≥90% of deliverables linked to measurable outcomes. |
| **Ownership Balance** | Each outcome has both Client and Vendor sign-off. |
| **Outcome Achievement Rate** | ≥70% of outcomes meet or exceed targets within timeframe. |
| **Transparency Signal** | Outcome data visible in shared governance dashboards. |

## Common Pitfalls

- Defining outputs instead of outcomes (e.g., “launch feature” vs. “improve conversion”).
- Assigning accountability to only one side.
- Lacking baselines or measurable verification.
- Using vanity KPIs disconnected from value realization.
- Allowing changes without proper traceability and sign-off.

## Contract Lifecycle

| Stage | Action | Responsible Roles |
|--------|---------|------------------|
| **Creation** | Drafted during Discovery and attached to Engagement Contract. | Product Leaders, Account Leads |
| **Activation** | Validated before the first delivery milestone. | Executive Sponsor, Delivery Facilitator |
| **Review** | Revisited quarterly during Maturity or Governance reviews. | Product Leaders, Governance Officers |
| **Renewal** | Updated upon scope change, product release, or new maturity stage. | Account Leads |

## Client-Side Application

**Objective:** Guarantee that every funded effort is tied to business outcomes and value realization.

**Client actions**

1. Define clear, quantifiable outcomes and baselines.
2. Validate alignment between outcome and delivery capability.
3. Participate in quarterly outcome verification sessions.
4. Use outcome data for strategic prioritization and renewal decisions.

## Vendor-Side Application

**Objective:** Demonstrate business impact, not just delivery completion.

**Vendor actions**

1. Align backlog and technical scope to outcome metrics.
2. Provide measurement mechanisms and data dashboards.
3. Report progress in governance cadence transparently.
4. Document learning when outcomes diverge from expectations.

## Summary

The **Outcome-to-Accountability Agreement** transforms project objectives into **shared, measurable commitments**.<br/>
It closes the gap between *client expectations* and *vendor execution*, ensuring every feature or deliverable serves a validated business purpose.

By signing this agreement, both organizations commit to **Outcome before Output** — the foundation of 3SF’s value-driven collaboration.
