# 520 Glossary

The **3-in-3 SDLC Framework (3SF)** introduces a shared language to describe the systemic relationships between **Client**, **Vendor**, and **Product (or Service)**.<br/>
This glossary defines the core concepts and terminology used across 3SF Theory, Practice, and Contracts.

## Core Model Terms

| Term | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| **3-in-3 System** | The foundational model aligning three parties — *Client*, *Vendor*, and *Product (or Service)* — through three relationships: *Engagement*, *Delivery*, and *Value*. |
| **Engagement** | The relationship between *Client* and *Vendor*, focused on collaboration, alignment, and mutual understanding. |
| **Delivery** | The relationship between *Vendor* and *Product (or Service)*, focused on execution, quality, and predictability. |
| **Value** | The relationship between *Product (or Service)* and *Client*, focused on realized outcomes and satisfaction. |
| **Triangle Model** | Visual representation of the 3-in-3 System, showing the three entities and three connecting relationships. |
| **3SF Lifecycle** | A cyclical framework for discovering, shaping, delivering, and evolving engagements across the Client–Vendor–Product system. |

## Structural Elements

| Term | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Layer** | Logical grouping in 3SF Theory that defines the system structure and stability (e.g., *Stable Rules Layer*, *Contextual Drivers Layer*). |
| **Stable Rules Layer (SRL)** | The foundation layer defining universal principles that preserve delivery system coherence. |
| **Contextual Drivers Layer (CDL)** | Layer describing external and internal factors that shape engagement and delivery configuration. |
| **Contract** | A defined agreement (formal or informal) establishing how roles or systems interact — includes governance, autonomy, and accountability models. |
| **Canvas** | A visual facilitation tool (e.g., *Engagement Context Canvas*) used for discovery and alignment workshops. |
| **Artifact** | A structured output or template (contract, matrix, dashboard, or record) representing decisions or agreements. |

## System Concepts

| Term | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Systemic Friction** | Persistent misalignment between system parts — information flow, accountability, or decision rights — that reduces delivery performance. |
| **Systemic Learning** | Continuous improvement approach that transforms incidents and feedback into organizational growth. |
| **Autonomy** | The degree of self-governance and decision-making freedom granted to a team or organization within agreed boundaries. |
| **Control** | Mechanisms or boundaries that maintain coherence and prevent systemic drift while allowing autonomy. |
| **Alignment** | Shared understanding of goals, direction, and responsibilities across Client and Vendor teams. |
| **Coherence** | The ability of all elements in the delivery system to fit together without internal conflict or redundancy. |
| **Accountability** | Shared ownership for outcomes, measured through jointly defined indicators and agreements. |
| **Governance** | The structure of oversight, decision-making cadence, and escalation mechanisms within an engagement. |

## Maturity and Metrics

| Term | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Maturity Model** | A structured framework describing progressive stages of relationship and system development — from *Reactive* to *Strategic*. |
| **Maturity Growth Contract (MGC)** | Agreement defining the roadmap and cadence for evolving engagement maturity. |
| **Maturity Velocity (MV)** | The rate of improvement in maturity score across time, used to track relationship evolution. |
| **Engagement Maturity Index (EMI)** | Metric summarizing average maturity across active engagements. |
| **Delivery Maturity Index (DMI)** | Metric reflecting delivery predictability and flow efficiency. |
| **Value Maturity Index (VMI)** | Metric showing the proportion of delivered outputs linked to measurable outcomes. |

## Practices and Tools

| Term | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Engagement Context Canvas (ECC)** | A diagnostic tool that captures environmental and organizational context before engagement kickoff. |
| **Outcome-to-Accountability Map (OAM)** | A mapping that connects desired outcomes to accountable roles and measurable outputs. |
| **Outcome-to-Accountability Agreement (OAA)** | Governance annex that formalizes how business results are tied to deliverables and ownership. |
| **Autonomy & Control Boundary Agreement (ACBA)** | Defines decision-making rights, control mechanisms, and escalation paths between Client and Vendor. |
| **Flow Constraint Identification (FCI)** | Joint diagnostic practice to detect and address bottlenecks in the delivery system. |
| **Learning Before Blame Protocol (LBP)** | A principle for converting incidents into systemic learning opportunities rather than fault-finding exercises. |
| **Quarterly Alignment Record (QAR)** | Periodic summary of alignment status, decisions, and follow-up actions across engagements. |

## Relationship and Evolution Terms

| Term | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Relationship Evolution Contract (REC)** | Agreement defining how the partnership renews, scales, or transitions based on maturity data. |
| **Partnership Confidence Index (PCI)** | Sentiment-based indicator of trust and collaboration strength between Client and Vendor. |
| **Systemic Risk Ratio (SRR)** | Indicator showing the proportion of projects trending toward higher systemic risk or maturity decline. |
| **Governance Contract (GC)** | Defines governance cadence, escalation paths, and decision-making authorities. |

## Flow and Operations

| Term | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Flow** | The smooth progression of work items from initiation to completion with minimal delays or context switching. |
| **Work in Progress (WIP)** | A control mechanism that limits concurrent work to maintain flow and predictability. |
| **Value Stream Map (VSM)** | A visualization tool mapping the end-to-end delivery process to identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies. |
| **Mean Time to Detect (MTTD)** | Average duration between the occurrence of an incident and its detection. |
| **Mean Time to Recover (MTTR)** | Average duration required to restore service after an incident. |
| **Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)** | Average operational duration between two production incidents, used to track reliability. |

## Reference Purpose

This glossary ensures **terminological consistency** across all layers of the 3SF Framework and supports:

- Alignment of understanding between Client and Vendor roles.
- Easier onboarding of new practitioners.
- Integration of 3SF concepts into organizational playbooks, training, and tooling.
