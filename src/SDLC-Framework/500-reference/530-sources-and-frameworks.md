# 530 Sources and Frameworks

The **3-in-3 SDLC Framework (3SF)** builds upon a wide spectrum of proven methodologies, systems-thinking traditions, and continuous-improvement practices.<br/>
This section lists the **external sources, frameworks, and practices** that influenced or complement 3SF Theory, Practice, and Maturity models.

Each source is categorized according to its **dominant contribution area** — strategic, systemic, operational, or relational — illustrating how 3SF integrates diverse schools of thought into one coherent delivery framework.

## Strategic Alignment and Visioning

| Framework / Practice | Core Idea | Relevance to 3SF |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **VMOSA (Vision, Mission, Objectives, Strategy, Action)** | A structured planning model connecting purpose to measurable actions. | Provides the basis for outcome-driven governance and alignment between Client and Vendor vision layers. |

## Delivery, Quality, and Technical Practices

| Framework / Practice | Core Idea | Relevance to 3SF |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **SDLC (Software Development Lifecycle)** | Structured phases guiding software development and delivery. | 3SF reframes SDLC through relational systems — linking Delivery to Engagement and Value. |
| **DORA Metrics** | Quantitative delivery performance indicators (deployment frequency, MTTR, etc.). | Forms part of the *Delivery Maturity Index (DMI)* and *Systemic Risk Ratio (SRR)*. |
| **DevOps & CI/CD** | Integration of development and operations for continuous delivery. | Supports flow and operational stability within Delivery relationship. |
| **SAMM (Software Assurance Maturity Model)** | Framework for assessing and improving software security practices. | Inspires 3SF’s maturity measurement and capability growth principles. |
| **CMMI (Capability Maturity Model Integration)** | Process maturity framework for organizations. | Provides historical context for structured improvement models used in 3SF. |
| **ITIL** | Library of IT service management best practices. | Complements *Value* relationship by ensuring service reliability and post-delivery governance. |
| **Risk Management (ISO 31000)** | Systematic approach to managing uncertainty and risk. | Informs *Governance Contracts (GC)* and risk traceability across engagements. |

## Collaboration and Relationship Management

| Framework / Practice | Core Idea | Relevance to 3SF |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **RACI Matrix** | Clarifies roles: Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed. | Influences accountability mapping in *OAM* and *Governance Contracts (GC)*. |
| **Situational Leadership (Hersey & Blanchard)** | Adjusts leadership style based on team maturity and readiness. | Mirrors adaptive autonomy in 3SF’s *Engagement* and *Maturity Growth* dynamics. |
| **Radical Candor (Scott)** | Communication framework balancing care and challenge. | Encourages open dialogue between Client and Vendor roles. |
| **Multipliers (Wiseman)** | Leadership model that amplifies team capability through empowerment. | Aligns with 3SF’s principle of shared ownership and co-evolution. |
| **Psychological Safety (Edmondson)** | Foundation for team learning and innovation. | Embedded in *Learning Before Blame Protocol (LBP)*. |

## Measurement and Improvement Frameworks

| Framework / Practice | Core Idea | Relevance to 3SF |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Value Stream Mapping (Lean)** | Visualization of material and information flow in a process. | Forms basis of 3SF’s *Flow Constraint Identification (FCI)* practice. |
| **OKR & KPI Integration** | Combining leading and lagging indicators to track outcomes. | Shapes 3SF’s *Maturity Indexes* (EMI, DMI, VMI) and *Outcome-to-Accountability* metrics. |
| **PDCA Cycle (Plan–Do–Check–Act)** | Continuous improvement loop. | Embedded in 3SF’s maturity evolution and *Quarterly Alignment Record (QAR)* cadence. |
| **SRE (Site Reliability Engineering)** | Engineering discipline balancing reliability and velocity. | Enriches operational side of 3SF’s *Delivery* relationship and MTTR/MTTD metrics. |

## Governance, Compliance, and Standards

## Integrative Models Introduced by 3SF

| Model | Description | Derived From / Connected To |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **3-in-3 SDLC Framework (3SF)** | Relationship-aware SDLC model connecting Client, Vendor, and Product into one system. | Inspired by SDLC + Systems Thinking + Team Topologies. |
| **3-in-3 Maturity Model** | Self-assessment tool mapping systemic evolution from reactive to strategic. | Derived from CMMI, SAMM, and Lean maturity structures. |
| **3-in-3 Metrics Model** | Defines interconnected indexes (EMI, DMI, VMI, MV, SRR, PCI). | Synthesizes DORA, OKR, and Balanced Scorecard concepts. |
| **3SF Contracts System** | Family of agreements (ACBA, GC, OAA, MGC, REC) defining interaction rules. | Influenced by governance models and systemic agreements in organizational theory. |

## Reference Philosophy

3SF does not *replace* these frameworks — it **integrates** and **orchestrates** them through a systemic lens.<br/>
It treats each external source as a **function** within a broader delivery ecosystem, ensuring that strategic intent, organizational design, and delivery execution remain coherent and measurable.

> **In essence:**<br/>
> 3SF = (Systems Thinking + SDLC) × (Relational Maturity + Delivery Flow)<br/>
> enriched by lessons from Lean, Agile, and Organizational Design sciences.
