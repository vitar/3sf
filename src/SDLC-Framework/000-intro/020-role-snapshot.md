# Role Responsibility Snapshot – Dual-Sided Accountability

> *“Every 3SF role exists in pairs — one defines the value, the other delivers it.”*

## Purpose

The **Role Responsibility Snapshot** helps both **Client** and **Vendor** teams understand their joint accountabilities within the 3SF system.<br/>
It serves as a **single reference point for all functional roles** and a **bridge between the 3SF Principles and Practice Tools**, showing what each role contributes and owns at every stage of delivery.

Use this guide when forming teams, preparing for workshops, or validating who brings what into a 3SF tool.

## How to Use

1. Find your **role** (Client or Vendor side).
2. Review your **primary accountability** — your “WHY.”
3. See which **artifact** you provide input to and which one you are expected to **own or co-sign**.
4. Use these as checkpoints when applying the [Engagement Context Canvas](../200-practice/205-engagement-context-canvas.md), [Outcome Map](../200-practice/220-outcome-accountability-map.md), or [Boundary Charter](../200-practice/210-autonomy-control-charter.md).

## Co-Dependent SDLC System Roles

These are the **core joint execution functions** that drive the SDLC and manage the relationships between **Client ↔ Vendor ↔ Product**.

| Functional Core | Primary Accountability (The WHY) | Typical Title Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Product Leader** | Owns *What* (Value) and *How* (Solution Strategy). | Client Product Owner / Vendor Product Manager |
| **Delivery Facilitator** | Owns *Flow*, removes impediments, and manages *systemic friction*. | Client Project Manager / Vendor Delivery Lead |
| **Solution Architect** | Owns *Coherence*, structural integrity, and architectural *trade-offs*. | Client Solution Architect / Vendor Solution Architect |
| **Technical Integrator** | Owns *Technical Execution*, operational readiness, and integration *quality*. | Client Technical Integrator / Vendor Technical Integrator |
| **Requirements Analyst** | Owns *Clarity*, domain expertise, and the *translation* of business needs. | Client Requirements Analyst / Vendor Requirements Analyst |
| **Experience Designer** | Owns *Usability*, user needs, and experience-driven value translation. | Client Experience Lead / Vendor Experience Lead |

These roles are **systemic mirrors** — each has a counterpart across the Client/Vendor line to ensure joint accountability.

## Principle Alignment Map

Each pairing of Client ↔ Vendor roles supports a **core 3SF Principle**, defining how accountability manifests across collaboration lines.

| 3SF Principle | Typical Role Pair | Supporting Tool |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Context before Method** | Client Product Owner ↔ Vendor Delivery Lead | [Engagement Context Canvas](../200-practice/205-engagement-context-canvas.md) |
| **Trust before Control** | Executive Sponsor ↔ Vendor Account Lead | [Autonomy & Control Boundary Charter](../200-practice/210-autonomy-control-charter.md) |
| **Outcome before Output** | Client Product Owner ↔ Vendor Product Manager | [Outcome-to-Accountability Map](../200-practice/220-outcome-accountability-map.md) |
| **Learning before Blame** | Client Project Manager ↔ Vendor Delivery Lead | [Learning Before Blame Protocol](../200-practice/265-learning-before-blame-protocol.md) |
| **Shared Accountability** | Client & Vendor Solution Architects | [Architectural Trade-Off Contract](../200-practice/235-architectural-tradeoff-contract.md) |

These alignments make **joint accountability visible and inspectable** — every tool has an owner pair, and every decision has a shared signature.

## Summary

> **Dual-Sided Accountability = Joint Clarity × Shared Learning**

The **Role Responsibility Snapshot** and **Functional Role Model** together form the *people layer* of 3SF.<br/>
They define *who* owns *what* — making all 3SF tools actionable through clear accountability pairs.

Each 3SF artifact has:

- A **Client counterpart**,
- A **Vendor counterpart**, and
- A **Shared purpose**.

Together, they transform organizational boundaries into a **system of cooperation, not control**.
