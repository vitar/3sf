# Role Responsibility Snapshot – Dual-Sided Accountability

> *“Every 3SF role exists in pairs — one defines the value, the other delivers it.”*

## Purpose

The **Role Responsibility Snapshot** helps both **Client** and **Vendor** teams understand their joint accountabilities within the 3SF system.<br/>
It serves as a **bridge between the Functional Role Model** and **Practice Tools**, showing what each role contributes and owns at every stage of delivery.

Use this guide when forming teams, preparing for workshops, or validating who brings what into a 3SF tool.

## How to Use

1. Find your **role** (Client or Vendor side).
2. Review the **primary accountability** — your “WHY.”
3. See which **artifact** you provide input to and which one you are expected to **own or co-sign**.
4. Use these as checkpoints in the **Engagement Context Canvas**, **Outcome Map**, or **Boundary Charter**.

| **Vendor Technical Integrator** | Execute integration and ensure system operates end-to-end. | [**DoD Matrix**](../200-practice/272-shared-definition-of-done.md) | Verified delivery pipeline readiness |
| **Client Requirements Analyst** | Clarify business intent and domain logic. | Business inputs for ECC and OAM | Refined acceptance criteria for [**Shared Definition of Done**](../200-practice/272-shared-definition-of-done.md) |
| **Vendor Requirements Analyst** | Translate business context into development-ready scope. | [**ECC**](../200-practice/276-engagement-context-canvas.md) | Finalized scope specification for backlog execution |
| **Experience Designer (Client/Vendor)** | Own usability and user value translation. | User research insights | Prototype or design specification linked to [**Outcome Map**](../200-practice/270-outcome-accountability-map.md) |

## 2. Client-Only Fixed Roles

| Functional Role | Primary Accountability | Key Engagement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Executive Sponsor** | Own strategic intent, funding, and highest-level trust decisions. | Approves [**Autonomy & Control Boundary Charter**](../200-practice/274-autonomy-control-charter.md) |
| **Vendor Manager** | Manage commercial relationship, contracts, and maturity evaluation. | Uses [**Maturity Dashboard**](../200-practice/260-maturity-dashboard.md) |
| **Governance Officer** | Ensure regulatory and internal compliance adherence. | Reviews [**Architectural Trade-Off Contract**](../200-practice/271-architectural-tradeoff-contract.md) and [**DoD Matrix**](../200-practice/272-shared-definition-of-done.md) |

## 3. Vendor-Only Fixed Roles

| Functional Role | Primary Accountability | Key Engagement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Account Lead** | Own overall commercial health and client relationship maturity. | Consolidates [**Maturity Dashboard**](../200-practice/260-maturity-dashboard.md) and [**Quarterly Assessment**](../200-practice/230-quarterly-assessment.md) |
| **Engineering Director** | Manage delivery capacity and systemic maturity across teams. | Oversees [**Delivery System Diagnostic**](../200-practice/220-delivery-system-diagnostic.md) |
| **Practice Lead** | Maintain discipline standards and systemic improvement. | Reviews outputs of [**Architectural Trade-Off Contract**](../200-practice/271-architectural-tradeoff-contract.md) and [**DoD Matrix**](../200-practice/272-shared-definition-of-done.md) |
| **Engineering Specialist** | Deliver hands-on technical implementation and quality verification. | Contributes to [**DoD Matrix**](../200-practice/272-shared-definition-of-done.md) |

## 4. How It Connects

Each pairing of Client ↔ Vendor roles aligns to a **specific 3SF Principle**:

| Principle | Typical Role Pair | Supporting Tool |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Context before Method** | Client Product Owner ↔ Vendor Delivery Lead | [Engagement Context Canvas](../200-practice/276-engagement-context-canvas.md) |
| **Trust before Control** | Executive Sponsor ↔ Vendor Account Lead | [Autonomy & Control Boundary Charter](../200-practice/274-autonomy-control-charter.md) |
| **Outcome before Output** | Client Product Owner ↔ Vendor Product Manager | [Outcome-to-Accountability Map](../200-practice/270-outcome-accountability-map.md) |
| **Learning before Blame** | Client Project Manager ↔ Vendor Delivery Lead | [Learning Before Blame Protocol](../200-practice/275-learning-before-blame-protocol.md) |
| **Shared Accountability** | Client & Vendor Solution Architects | [Architectural Trade-Off Contract](../200-practice/271-architectural-tradeoff-contract.md) |

These alignments make **joint accountability visible and inspectable** — every tool has an owner pair, every decision has a shared signature.

## 5. Summary

> **Dual-Sided Accountability = Joint Clarity × Shared Learning**

The **Role Responsibility Snapshot** transforms abstract collaboration into actionable co-ownership.<br/>
It ensures every 3SF artifact has a **client counterpart, a vendor counterpart, and a shared purpose** — turning roles into an integrated system of responsibility, not hierarchy.
