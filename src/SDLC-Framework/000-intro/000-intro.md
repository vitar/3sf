# 3SF Quick Start – From Context to Practice

> *“3SF is not another delivery method — it’s the operating system that connects them all.”*

## What Is 3SF

The **3-in-3 SDLC Framework (3SF)** is a **relationship-aware delivery system** that unites **Client**, **Vendor**, and **Product / Service** into one coherent ecosystem.

Where most frameworks describe *how teams deliver*, 3SF explains **how organizations align** — showing how engagement, delivery, and value form an integrated system of trust and flow.

At its core lies a simple triangle:

```

      Product | Service
             / ^
            /   \
     Value /     \ Delivery
          /       \
         /         \
        /           \
       v             \
  Client <----------> Vendor
          Engagement

```

Each side of this triangle represents a **relationship line**:

- **Engagement** — how Client and Vendor collaborate.
- **Delivery** — how Vendor and Product interact to produce outcomes.
- **Value** — how Product results satisfy Client goals.

When all three sides evolve together, delivery becomes aligned, predictable, and continuously learning.

## Why 3SF Exists

3SF emerged from real-world experience across hundreds of projects where success or failure was rarely technical.
It almost always came down to **misaligned expectations, responsibilities, and maturity** between client and vendor teams.

3SF was designed to fix that by:

- Making **relationships inspectable and measurable**.
- Providing **shared tools** that connect strategy to execution.
- Replacing blame with **systemic learning**.
- Turning transactional projects into **strategic partnerships**.

## How to Navigate 3SF

The framework is structured like an **operating system**:

| Layer | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Theory (OS)** | Explains *why* 3SF exists and *how* it structures relationships. |
| **Practice (Apps)** | Shows *how* to use 3SF tools in real projects. |
| **Contracts (Interfaces)** | Define how principles become measurable agreements. |

Each section builds on the previous one — but you don’t need to read it linearly.<br/>
