## The 3SF Navigator – Context-Driven Tool Finder

> *“Start with your situation, not the method.”*

### Purpose

The **3SF Navigator** helps you quickly find which 3SF Practice Tool fits your current situation.<br/>
Instead of reading the full framework, this guide begins with **your context** — what you are trying to achieve — and directs you to the right artifact or diagnostic.

It complements the **3SF Practice Architecture** by acting as a lightweight *user interface* for the 3SF Operating System.

### How to Use

1. Identify **your current need or challenge** below.
2. Find the **matching situation** in the table.
3. Open the linked **3SF Tool** to apply immediately.
4. Use the associated **3SF Principle** as your guiding mindset.

### Find Your Situation

| My Current Situation (Need) | SDLC Stage | Primary Tool | Target 3SF Principle |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **“We need to define the project’s rules of engagement.”** | Discover / Setup | [**Engagement Context Canvas**](../200-practice/205-engagement-context-canvas.md) | *Context before Method* |
| **“We need to set the boundaries for approval authority.”** | Shape / Governance | [**Autonomy & Control Boundary Charter**](../200-practice/210-autonomy-control-charter.md) | *Trust before Control* |
| **“We need to monitor relationship and delivery maturity.”** | Run / Evolve | [**Maturity Dashboard**](../200-practice/215-maturity-dashboard.md) | *Transparency Enables Adaptation* |
| **“We need to define what success looks like.”** | Discover / Shape | [**Outcome-to-Accountability Map**](../200-practice/220-outcome-accountability-map.md) | *Outcome before Output* |
| **“We need a shared Definition of Done.”** | Build / Validate | [**Shared Definition of Done (DoD) Matrix**](../200-practice/225-shared-definition-of-done.md) | *Quality before Speed* |
| **“We need to identify what slows us down.”** | Build / Run | [**Flow Constraint Identification**](../200-practice/230-flow-constraint-identification.md) | *Flow before Speed* |
| **“We need to align on key architectural trade-offs.”** | Shape / Build | [**Architectural Trade-Off Contract**](../200-practice/235-architectural-tradeoff-contract.md) | *Shared Accountability* |
| **“We need to formalize initial delivery setup.”** | Discover / Setup | [**Initial Delivery System Design**](../200-practice/240-initial-delivery-design.md) | *System before Tools* |
| **“Our delivery is messy. We need to find the systemic cause.”** | Build / Run | [**Delivery System Diagnostic**](../200-practice/245-delivery-system-diagnostic.md) | *Learning before Blame* |
| **“We need to evaluate partnership performance.”** | Run / Evolve | [**Quarterly Delivery & Relationship Assessment**](../200-practice/250-quarterly-assessment.md) | *Transparency Enables Adaptation* |
| **“We want to learn from delivery issues without blaming.”** | Evolve / Reflect | [**Learning Before Blame Protocol**](../200-practice/265-learning-before-blame-protocol.md) | *Learning before Blame* |

### Quick Reference by SDLC Stage

#### **Discover**

- [Engagement Context Canvas](../200-practice/205-engagement-context-canvas.md) — define context and collaboration rules.
- [Outcome-to-Accountability Map](../200-practice/220-outcome-accountability-map.md) — define measurable success.
- [Initial Delivery System Design](../200-practice/240-initial-delivery-design.md) — establish delivery configuration.

#### **Shape**

- [Autonomy & Control Boundary Charter](../200-practice/210-autonomy-control-charter.md) — define decision-making rights.
- [Architectural Trade-Off Contract](../200-practice/235-architectural-tradeoff-contract.md) — agree on non-functional trade-offs.

#### **Build**

- [Shared Definition of Done Matrix](../200-practice/225-shared-definition-of-done.md) — ensure cross-functional quality.
- [Flow Constraint Identification](../200-practice/230-flow-constraint-identification.md) — locate top systemic blockers.
- [Delivery System Diagnostic](../200-practice/245-delivery-system-diagnostic.md) — analyze systemic friction.

#### **Run**

- [Maturity Dashboard](../200-practice/215-maturity-dashboard.md) — visualize relationship health and delivery maturity.
- [Quarterly Delivery & Relationship Assessment](../200-practice/250-quarterly-assessment.md) — monitor partnership progress.

#### **Evolve**

- [Learning Before Blame Protocol](../200-practice/265-learning-before-blame-protocol.md) — conduct structured retrospectives.
- [Relationship Audit](../200-practice/260-relationship-audit.md) — portfolio-level comparison and learning.

### When in Doubt

Start with one of these entry points:

- **If your project hasn’t started:** use the [Engagement Context Canvas](../200-practice/205-engagement-context-canvas.md).
- **If you’re defining governance:** use the [Autonomy & Control Boundary Charter](../200-practice/210-autonomy-control-charter.md).
- **If you need measurable insight:** use the [Maturity Dashboard](../200-practice/215-maturity-dashboard.md).
- **If you’re already delivering:** use the [Delivery System Diagnostic](../200-practice/245-delivery-system-diagnostic.md).
- **If you’re closing or scaling:** use the [Quarterly Assessment](../200-practice/250-quarterly-assessment.md).

When clarity improves, connect these tools through the [3SF Practice Architecture](../200-practice/200-practice-architecture.md) for full lifecycle alignment.

### Governance & Diagnostics

When oversight or measurement is the main concern, use the tools that connect delivery with systemic learning:

- [**Contracts Architecture**](../300-contracts/300-contracts-architecture.md) — defines governance and commitment interfaces.
- [**Maturity Dashboard**](../200-practice/215-maturity-dashboard.md) — monitors relationship health.
- [**Rule Audit Checklist (RAC)**](../100-theory/130-rule-audit-checklist.md) and [**Contextual Rules Catalog (CRC)**](../100-theory/135-contextual-rules-catalog.md) — evaluate rule adherence and improvement priorities.

### Summary

> **3SF Navigator = Context → Principle → Practice**<br/>
> It’s the entry point into the 3SF Operating System — guiding users to the right tool, at the right time, for the right reason.
