# Self-Diagnostic and Reflection Tool

> *“Systems evolve only when their people reflect.”*

## Purpose

The **3SF Self-Diagnostic** enables **individuals and small teams** to reflect on their contribution to the joint delivery system and relationship maturity.

It transforms *personal perception* into *systemic awareness* — revealing how each role, action, or decision affects **Engagement**, **Delivery**, and **Value** lines across the 3SF model.

This tool helps:

- Recognize blind spots before they escalate into team or client tension,
- Reinforce alignment between individual purpose and system goals,
- Build a culture of self-correction and trust across organizations.

## Applies To

| Dimension | Scope |
|------------|-------|
| **SDLC Stages** | Any ongoing project stage |
| **3SF Relationship Lines** | Engagement ↔ Delivery ↔ Value |
| **3SF Layers** | Rule Audit Checklist (RAC) |
| **Maturity Target** | From *Collaborative Confidence* → toward *Co-Creative Trust* (individual level) |

## Actors / Roles

Applicable to all **functional cores** defined in the 3SF Functional Role Model, e.g.:

| Role | Reflective Focus |
|------|------------------|
| **Product Leader** | Balancing value definition with delivery realism. |
| **Delivery Facilitator** | Maintaining flow and psychological safety. |
| **Solution Architect** | Ensuring technical coherence serves outcomes. |
| **Technical Integrator** | Safeguarding quality and reducing friction. |
| **Requirements Analyst** | Clarifying what matters most and why. |
| **Experience Designer** | Keeping user value central across trade-offs. |
| **Executive Sponsor / Account Lead** | Enabling trust and transparency from leadership. |

## Steps / Routines

1. **Set the Reflection Context**
   - Choose a time window (last sprint, quarter, or milestone).
   - Reflect individually or as a small peer group (2–5 participants).
   - Prepare the last **Quarterly Assessment** or **Diagnostic** as context.

2. **Answer Reflection Questions**
   - Use the **3x3 Reflection Grid** (below).
   - Rate yourself 1–5 (1 = rarely true, 5 = consistently true).
   - Write short examples for scores ≤3.

   | Relationship Line | Typical Reflection Questions |
   |--------------------|-------------------------------|
   | **Engagement** | Do I maintain clarity in cross-team communication?<br/>Do I address misalignment early?<br/>Do I contribute to mutual trust? |
   | **Delivery** | Do I help simplify complexity?<br/>Do I keep commitments realistic?<br/>Do I help others succeed across boundaries? |
   | **Value** | Do I understand why my work matters to the end user or client?<br/>Do I connect outputs to outcomes?<br/>Do I seek feedback on impact? |

3. **Identify Learning Signals**
   - Review your lowest 2–3 ratings — they represent current learning edges.
   - Link each to a 3SF layer or maturity gap (e.g., unclear Stable Rule, missing feedback loop).

4. **Create an Action Pledge**
   - Choose one improvement commitment for the next iteration.
   - Frame it as a behavior: “I will start / stop / continue…”
   - Share it with your Delivery Facilitator or Product Leader.

5. **Revisit After One Cycle**
   - At next sprint or quarterly review, reflect on what changed.
   - Integrate learning into the team’s improvement backlog.

## Inputs / Outputs

| Inputs | Outputs |
|---------|----------|
| Last Diagnostic / Assessment results, project retrospectives, personal notes | **Reflection Grid**, **Action Pledge**, optionally shared **Reflection Summary** |

## Metrics / Signals

| Category | Example Indicators |
|-----------|--------------------|
| **Awareness Growth** | Increase in individual reflection depth over 2 cycles. |
| **Behavioral Change** | Observable alignment between reflection actions and delivery outcomes. |
| **Psychological Safety** | 80% of team members report feeling safe to speak about issues openly. |
| **Learning Culture** | Reflections discussed in retrospectives at least once per iteration. |

## Common Pitfalls

- Treating reflection as evaluation instead of learning.
- Focusing only on personal comfort, not on system contribution.
- Lack of follow-up — reflection without visible change.
- Using scores as performance metrics instead of awareness indicators.
- Conducting reflection in isolation from client or cross-functional peers.

## Scaling Notes

| Maturity Stage | Evolution Focus |
|----------------|-----------------|
| **Collaborative → Co-Creative** | Peer reflections become team rituals; feedback becomes normalized. |
| **Co-Creative → Strategic Partner** | Reflections feed into leadership training and organizational maturity programs. |

## Client-Side Application

**Objective:** Build reflective leadership habits that improve vendor collaboration and value realization.

**Client actions**

1. Encourage Product Leaders and Governance Officers to run reflections after each milestone.
2. Connect reflection insights to improvement areas identified in Quarterly Assessments.
3. Use outcomes to adjust internal dependencies (e.g., approval flow, release cadence).
4. Demonstrate accountability by sharing top insights with the vendor team.

## Vendor-Side Application

**Objective:** Reinforce ownership, humility, and transparency inside delivery teams.

**Vendor actions**

1. Integrate reflections into retrospectives or end-of-phase reviews.
2. Use reflection outcomes to identify internal capability gaps (skills, communication, tools).
3. Share aggregated themes with the client to illustrate learning progress.
4. Include top insights in Delivery Facilitator and Practice Lead coaching plans.

## Summary

The **3SF Self-Diagnostic** empowers every participant — from engineer to executive — to become a conscious contributor to system maturity.<br/>
It turns reflection into a **core maintenance function** of the client-vendor relationship, ensuring that personal learning continuously fuels organizational evolution.

Use this tool regularly, even when everything seems fine — because systems thrive on awareness, not assumptions.
