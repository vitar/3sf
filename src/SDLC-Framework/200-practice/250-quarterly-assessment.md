## Quarterly Delivery and Relationship Assessment

> *“Partnership maturity grows through reflection, not reports.”*

#### Purpose

The **Quarterly Delivery and Relationship Assessment** provides a structured checkpoint to evaluate the **health, maturity, and trajectory** of the ongoing client–vendor engagement.

It measures both **delivery performance** and **relationship maturity** to:

- Identify what has evolved since the last Diagnostic or Assessment,
- Re-align expectations and metrics between Client and Vendor,
- Strengthen systemic trust and prevent silent degradation of engagement quality.

This tool turns continuous improvement into a shared quarterly ritual rather than a reactive exercise.

#### Applies To

| Dimension | Scope |
|------------|-------|
| **SDLC Stages** | Ongoing Delivery → MVP / v1 → Post-v1 Evolution |
| **3SF Relationship Lines** | Engagement ↔ Delivery ↔ Value |
| **3SF Layers** | Stable Rules Layer (SRL) + Rule Audit Checklist (RAC) |
| **Maturity Target** | From *Co-Creative Trust* → toward *Strategic Partnership* |

#### Actors / Roles

| Client Side | Vendor Side | Shared Purpose |
|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Executive Sponsor** | **Account Lead** | Ensure business and partnership alignment across portfolio. |
| **Product Leader** | **Delivery Facilitator** | Review delivery flow, backlog health, and outcome alignment. |
| **Solution Architect** | **Solution Architect** | Evaluate technical evolution and design integrity. |
| **Governance Officer** | **Engineering Director** | Verify compliance, continuity, and risk management. |
| **Requirements Analyst**, **Experience Designer** | **Technical Integrator**, **Practice Lead** | Review quality, usability, and system coherence. |

#### Steps / Routines

1. **Prepare Evidence and Signals**
   - Collect performance metrics (velocity, incidents, releases, satisfaction).
   - Summarize progress against previous Diagnostic and Improvement Backlog.
   - Compile survey or pulse feedback from both teams.

2. **Evaluate Relationship Maturity**
   - Apply the **3SF Maturity Grid** across all three relationship lines.
   - Rate current state and discuss deltas since last quarter.
   - Use narrative reasoning: “What changed, why, and what did we learn?”

3. **Assess Delivery Health**
   - Review flow efficiency, predictability, and outcome correlation.
   - Identify systemic blockers or cross-team dependencies.
   - Validate that stable rules (SRL) are still effective.

4. **Identify Next Maturity Levers**
   - Select one Engagement lever (e.g., trust rituals),<br/>
     one Delivery lever (e.g., joint planning),<br/>
     and one Value lever (e.g., outcome-based metrics).
   - Define targeted improvements for the next 3 months.

5. **Facilitate the Quarterly Review Session**
   - Conduct a 2-hour structured conversation led jointly by the Delivery Facilitator and Product Leader.
   - Include both Executive Sponsor and Account Lead for alignment on strategic direction.
   - Conclude with a signed **Quarterly Alignment Record (QAR)** summarizing decisions.

6. **Publish and Track**
   - Update the **Maturity Dashboard** and **Improvement Backlog**.
   - Plan follow-up in next retrospectives or governance meetings.

#### Inputs / Outputs

| Inputs | Outputs |
|---------|----------|
| Previous Diagnostic or Assessment reports, metrics dashboards, Improvement Backlog | **Quarterly Alignment Record (QAR)**, updated **Maturity Dashboard**, new **Improvement Plan** |

#### Metrics / Signals

| Category | Example Indicators |
|-----------|--------------------|
| **Maturity Delta** | +1 level on at least one relationship line per two quarters. |
| **Engagement Quality** | ≥ 80% survey score on trust, clarity, and communication. |
| **Delivery Health** | <15% churn in backlog due to unclear priorities. |
| **Value Realization** | ≥ 70% of delivered items linked to measurable outcomes. |
| **System Stability** | No recurring systemic issues across two consecutive quarters. |

#### Common Pitfalls

- Treating the assessment as a KPI review instead of a **relationship reflection**.
- Focusing only on delivery metrics and ignoring value signals.
- Lack of senior involvement (Sponsor / Account Lead).
- Overcomplicating the scoring instead of discussing narratives.
- Not translating insights into actionable next steps.

#### Scaling Notes

| Maturity Stage | Evolution Focus |
|----------------|-----------------|
| **Co-Creative → Strategic Partner** | Establish shared portfolio governance and joint success metrics. |
| **Strategic Partner → Integrated Partner** | Formalize 3SF assessments as part of enterprise governance cadence. |

At higher maturity, assessments evolve into **joint portfolio reviews** connecting multiple projects under one relationship umbrella.

#### Client-Side Application

**Objective:** Maintain visibility into how the vendor partnership contributes to both product outcomes and organizational learning.

**Client actions**

1. Gather stakeholder feedback (Product, IT, Compliance).
2. Validate vendor delivery outcomes against business KPIs.
3. Participate in rating and narrative discussion openly.
4. Identify internal policy or dependency changes required to sustain maturity growth.
5. Endorse the next-quarter improvement levers and allocate needed support.

#### Vendor-Side Application

**Objective:** Demonstrate delivery maturity, anticipate systemic risks, and nurture trust through transparency.

**Vendor actions**

1. Prepare delivery and relationship metrics with context and narrative.
2. Facilitate the assessment workshop jointly with the client.
3. Summarize improvement recommendations in QAR format.
4. Highlight proactive actions taken since last quarter.
5. Support governance follow-up and accountability tracking.

#### Summary

The **Quarterly Delivery and Relationship Assessment** transforms performance review into **relationship evolution**.<br/>
It anchors the 3SF maturity journey in real, measurable progress — ensuring that trust, value, and flow advance together.

This tool closes the feedback loop between **system observation** and **system evolution**, forming the foundation for strategic partnership readiness.
