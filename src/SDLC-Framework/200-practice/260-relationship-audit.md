# Relationship Audit and Portfolio Maturity Review

> *“Partnership health is the leading indicator of delivery success.”*

### Purpose

The **Relationship Audit and Portfolio Maturity Review** validates how well the client–vendor ecosystem performs as a **system of relationships**, not just a collection of projects.

It enables leadership teams on both sides to:

- Audit **Engagement, Delivery, and Value** relationships across projects,
- Identify systemic risks and recurring maturity gaps,
- Translate learning from individual assessments into **portfolio-level improvement actions**.

This tool closes the 3SF feedback loop — from individual reflection to organizational learning.

### Applies To

| Dimension | Scope |
|------------|-------|
| **SDLC Stages** | Post-MVP / Ongoing portfolio operations |
| **3SF Relationship Lines** | Engagement ↔ Delivery ↔ Value |
| **3SF Layers** | Contextual Drivers Layer (CDL) + Stable Rules Layer (SRL) + Rule Audit Checklist (RAC) |
| **Maturity Target** | From *Strategic Partnership* → toward *Integrated Partnership* |

### Actors / Roles

| Client Side | Vendor Side | Shared Purpose |
|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Executive Sponsor** | **Account Lead** | Align portfolio strategy and investment with delivery health. |
| **Governance Officer** | **Engineering Director** | Ensure compliance, continuity, and risk mitigation. |
| **Product Leader(s)** | **Delivery Facilitator(s)** | Share learning from active projects and surface systemic blockers. |
| **Vendor Manager** | **Practice Lead** | Review contract and performance alignment with maturity targets. |
| **Solution Architect(s)** | **Technical Integrator(s)** | Capture architectural and operational improvement patterns. |

### Steps / Routines

1. **Collect Inputs Across Projects**
   - Gather the latest **Quarterly Assessments**, **Diagnostics**, and **Self-Diagnostics**.
   - Extract recurring patterns in Engagement, Delivery, and Value relationship lines.

2. **Aggregate Maturity Data** 
   - Plot each project’s maturity level on the **3SF Portfolio Maturity Map**.
   - Highlight anomalies — e.g., strong delivery but weak engagement, or value lagging behind output.

3. **Analyze Systemic Causes**
   - Group issues by origin: *structural*, *behavioral*, *contextual*.
   - Determine which constraints are internal to the client, vendor, or shared.
   - Identify missing or outdated Stable Rules (SRL) at portfolio level.

4. **Facilitate the Portfolio Audit Session**
   - Conduct a half-day workshop co-led by the **Account Lead** and **Governance Officer**.
   - Include Executive Sponsor(s) for cross-project alignment and funding decisions.
   - Discuss trends, systemic risks, and improvement priorities.

5. **Define Portfolio Improvement Themes**
   - Select 2–3 strategic maturity themes for the next quarter (e.g., “decision latency reduction,” “shared risk management,” “value metrics adoption”).
   - Assign cross-project owners for each theme.

6. **Publish the Relationship Audit Report**
   - Summarize findings, visualizations, and improvement commitments.
   - Store in a shared governance repository accessible to both organizations.
   - Schedule next audit in 3–6 months.

### Inputs / Outputs

| Inputs | Outputs |
|---------|----------|
| Diagnostics, Quarterly Assessments, Self-Diagnostics, Delivery Charters | **Relationship Audit Report**, **Portfolio Maturity Map**, **Strategic Improvement Plan** |

### Metrics / Signals

| Category | Example Indicators |
|-----------|--------------------|
| **Portfolio Maturity Index** | Average maturity across projects improving +0.5 per audit cycle. |
| **Relationship Stability** | ≥ 80% of engagements remain active or renewed after 12 months. |
| **Value Consistency** | ≥ 70% of projects demonstrate measurable business outcomes. |
| **Governance Efficiency** | Decision latency reduced by ≥ 25% portfolio-wide. |
| **Learning Diffusion** | Best practices from one project adopted by ≥ 50% of others. |

### Common Pitfalls

- Treating the audit as compliance instead of **strategic learning**.
- Aggregating only delivery metrics without relationship indicators.
- Skipping qualitative narratives behind maturity scores.
- Failing to involve both client and vendor leadership at equal weight.
- Not converting audit results into actionable improvement themes.

### Scaling Notes

| Maturity Stage | Evolution Focus |
|----------------|-----------------|
| **Strategic → Integrated Partnership** | Establish joint governance boards using 3SF as a shared maturity language. |
| **Integrated → Institutionalized Partnership** | Embed 3SF metrics into enterprise OKRs and vendor management frameworks. |

At high maturity, Relationship Audits replace periodic vendor scorecards — becoming a **shared governance standard** between organizations.

### Client-Side Application

**Objective:** Ensure that vendor collaboration scales sustainably and contributes to strategic portfolio outcomes.

**Client actions**

1. Initiate the audit through Governance Officer or Executive Sponsor.
2. Collect cross-project evidence and invite vendor leadership to co-analyze results.
3. Use audit insights to adjust sourcing strategy, internal processes, and funding models.
4. Champion systemic improvement themes across departments.

### Vendor-Side Application

**Objective:** Demonstrate maturity leadership and partnership stewardship across the client portfolio.

**Vendor actions**

1. Consolidate maturity data from all projects with the same client.
2. Identify recurring patterns in engagement, delivery, and value translation.
3. Propose systemic improvements backed by evidence.
4. Collaborate with client governance in defining and tracking strategic themes.
5. Use outcomes to evolve internal playbooks and training curricula.

### Summary

The **Relationship Audit and Portfolio Maturity Review** elevates 3SF from a project framework to an **organizational governance model**.<br/>
It helps leadership teams on both sides move beyond performance management toward **shared strategic learning** — turning every project into a data point in a continuously improving partnership system.

When applied regularly, this tool ensures that trust, capability, and value creation grow together across the entire client–vendor ecosystem.
