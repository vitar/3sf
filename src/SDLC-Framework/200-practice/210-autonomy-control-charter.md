# Autonomy & Control Boundary Charter

> *“The higher the trust, the lighter the control — and the stronger the outcomes.”*

### Purpose

The **Autonomy & Control Boundary Charter (ACBC)** defines **decision-making rights** between the Client and Vendor based on current **relationship maturity**.<br/>
It replaces implicit power dynamics with explicit, measurable governance rules.

This tool operationalizes the 3SF principle **“Trust before Control”** by:

- Establishing transparent **autonomy levels** for each functional area (e.g., design, delivery, environment, finance),
- Making control mechanisms **adaptive to maturity**, not static to contract,
- Building mutual confidence in distributed accountability.

When used correctly, the ACBC becomes both a **trust contract** and a **risk management instrument** — reducing micromanagement and dependency escalation.

### Applies To

| Dimension | Scope |
|------------|-------|
| **SDLC Stages** | Design → Delivery → Governance |
| **3SF Relationship Lines** | Engagement ↔ Delivery |
| **3SF Layers** | Contextual Drivers Layer (CDL) + Stable Rules Layer (SRL) |
| **Maturity Target** | From *Transactional Trust* → toward *Strategic Partnership* |

### Actors / Roles

| Client Side | Vendor Side | Shared Purpose |
|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Executive Sponsor** | **Account Lead** | Approve and maintain autonomy boundaries. |
| **Governance Officer** | **Delivery Facilitator** | Define, monitor, and adapt decision rights. |
| **Product Leader** | **Solution Architect** | Operate within defined autonomy levels and escalate only by exception. |
| **Vendor Manager** | **Engineering Director** | Ensure commercial and quality assurance alignment. |

### Steps / Routines

1. **Define Governance Domains**
   - Identify key decision areas to structure the charter, e.g.:
     - *Scope & Requirements*
     - *Architecture & Technology*
     - *Delivery Process & Planning*
     - *Quality & Acceptance*
     - *Environment & Access*
     - *Budget & Change Control*

2. **Set Autonomy Levels by Maturity Stage**
   - For each domain, define who has autonomy at each maturity level:

     | Maturity Stage | Autonomy Description |
     |----------------|----------------------|
     | **Transactional** | Vendor executes predefined tasks; Client approval required for all changes >1 day or >€1k. |
     | **Collaborative** | Vendor can adjust plans within sprint or iteration scope; approval for budget-affecting changes only. |
     | **Co-Creative** | Vendor adjusts backlog priorities autonomously within agreed outcomes; joint review monthly. |
     | **Strategic** | Vendor and Client co-manage portfolio and share improvement budgets; approval by exception only. |

3. **Document Control Rules**
   - Specify which controls remain mandatory (e.g., security, compliance).
   - Define escalation criteria and response expectations for exceptions.

4. **Formalize the Charter**
   - Summarize decisions in a single-page **Autonomy & Control Matrix**.
   - Have both the **Executive Sponsor** and **Account Lead** approve and sign.
   - Store the charter in the shared Delivery Charter repository.

5. **Monitor and Adapt**
   - Review the charter quarterly during **Relationship Assessments**.
   - Adjust autonomy levels when maturity or trust indicators evolve.

### Inputs / Outputs

| Inputs | Outputs |
|---------|----------|
| Engagement model, risk register, delivery governance framework | **Autonomy & Control Boundary Charter**, updated **Governance Matrix**, approval record |

### Metrics / Signals

| Category | Example Indicators |
|-----------|--------------------|
| **Decision Latency** | Average approval cycle reduced by ≥30% over 2 quarters. |
| **Escalation Frequency** | <10% of decisions require escalation beyond defined boundaries. |
| **Trust Signal** | Both sides report improved confidence in governance transparency (≥4/5 in surveys). |
| **Control Compliance** | 100% of mandatory compliance controls still maintained. |

### Common Pitfalls

- Designing boundaries based on organizational hierarchy instead of maturity.
- Keeping autonomy static despite demonstrated trust growth.
- Over-controlling vendor delivery to “avoid risk,” creating bottlenecks.
- Neglecting to include compliance teams early in discussions.
- Not reviewing boundaries periodically as projects evolve.

### Scaling Notes

| Maturity Stage | Evolution Focus |
|----------------|-----------------|
| **Collaborative → Co-Creative** | Introduce adaptive controls based on performance indicators. |
| **Co-Creative → Strategic Partner** | Integrate autonomy levels into vendor scorecards and portfolio governance. |

At higher maturity, autonomy is not “granted” but **earned and measured**, becoming a primary trust KPI.

### Client-Side Application

**Objective:** Build confidence in vendor self-management while maintaining necessary safeguards.

**Client actions**

1. Lead the definition of control domains aligned to internal governance.
2. Approve the charter jointly with vendor leadership.
3. Regularly review metrics of autonomy success and control compliance.
4. Use autonomy growth as an indicator of partnership maturity.

### Vendor-Side Application

**Objective:** Earn autonomy through transparency and proactive governance participation.

**Vendor actions**

1. Collaborate on defining boundaries and acceptable levels of autonomy.
2. Demonstrate responsible independence by maintaining visibility and reporting.
3. Escalate issues only when charter criteria apply.
4. Use autonomy metrics as evidence of relationship maturity in audits.

### Summary

The **Autonomy & Control Boundary Charter** transforms trust into a **structured governance artifact**.<br/>
It provides measurable decision boundaries that evolve with maturity — ensuring **control exists to enable autonomy, not to restrict it.**<br/>
By co-owning this charter, Client and Vendor shift from supervision to partnership, reinforcing the 3SF foundation of **Trust before Control.**
