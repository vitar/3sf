# Initial Delivery System Design

> *“Every successful engagement starts with a consciously designed system, not an improvised process.”*

### Purpose

The **Initial Delivery System Design** tool establishes the **first working model** of collaboration between **Client** and **Vendor** before or during project kick-off.

It translates business intent into an executable delivery system by aligning:

- **Engagement expectations** between Client and Vendor,
- **Flow of work** and information across both organizations,
- **Stable rules** for decision-making, communication, and governance.

This tool closes the maturity gap between *contractual setup* and *operational collaboration* — helping both sides enter delivery with clarity instead of assumptions.

### Applies To

| Dimension | Scope |
|------------|-------|
| **SDLC Stages** | RFP → Discovery → Kick-off |
| **3SF Relationship Lines** | Engagement ↔ Delivery ↔ Value |
| **3SF Layers** | Contextual Drivers Layer (CDL) + Stable Rules Layer (SRL) |
| **Maturity Target** | From *Transactional Trust* → toward *Collaborative Confidence* |

### Actors / Roles

| Client Side | Vendor Side | Shared Purpose |
|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Executive Sponsor** | **Account Lead** | Define intent, funding logic, and partnership boundaries. |
| **Product Leader** | **Delivery Facilitator** | Translate business goals into flow and governance patterns. |
| **Solution Architect** | **Solution Architect** | Align architectural feasibility and constraints. |
| **Requirements Analyst** | **Requirements Analyst** | Clarify problem statements and validation criteria. |
| **Governance Officer** | **Engineering Director** | Ensure compliance, security, and resourcing stability. |

### Steps / Routines

#### 1. **Frame the Intent**

- Clarify *Why this product or service exists* and *What success looks like* for both sides.
- Record shared vision, constraints, and strategic assumptions in a **Delivery Charter**.

#### 2. **Map the Engagement System**

- Identify *interfaces* between Client ↔ Vendor ↔ Product.
- Define how information, priorities, and dependencies will flow.
- Visualize using a **3-in-3 Engagement Canvas** (triangle form).

#### 3. **Define Stable Rules**

- Agree on key collaboration practices (e.g., cadence, decision loops, escalation path).
- Select initial 3SF practices relevant to context (e.g., RACI, backlog management, risk log).

#### 4. **Assess Starting Maturity**

- Use a simplified 3SF Maturity Checklist to rate Engagement, Delivery, and Value relationships.
- Capture baseline scores to enable progress tracking after first quarter.

#### 5. **Validate System Coherence**

- Review with both technical and business representatives.
- Ensure the setup supports value realization, not only contract execution.

#### 6. **Publish and Commit**

- Share the agreed system (charter + canvas + checklist) across both organizations.
- Schedule a 6-week review to confirm the system works as intended.

### Inputs / Outputs

| Inputs | Outputs |
|---------|----------|
| RFP / SoW draft, strategic objectives, architectural outline | **Delivery Charter**, **Engagement Canvas**, **Maturity Baseline**, initial **Governance Matrix** |

### Metrics / Signals

| Category | Example Indicators |
|-----------|--------------------|
| **Alignment Quality** | Shared definition of “done” and measurable success criteria exist. |
| **Engagement Clarity** | Decision flow, communication cadence, and ownership map defined. |
| **Readiness Confidence** | Both sides confirm ability to start delivery without new dependencies. |
| **Maturity Signal** | Baseline shows at least *Collaborative* level on Engagement and Delivery lines. |

### Common Pitfalls

- Treating the exercise as documentation instead of *system design*.
- Letting either side dominate — missing true co-ownership.
- Starting delivery without defining communication rhythm or decision rules.
- Ignoring cross-organizational dependencies (security, access, procurement).
- Focusing on individual roles instead of *relationships between functions*.

### Scaling Notes

| Maturity Stage | Evolution Focus |
|----------------|-----------------|
| **Transactional → Collaborative** | Move from single-point contacts to functional interfaces (Product ↔ Delivery ↔ Architecture). |
| **Collaborative → Co-Creative** | Integrate metrics and shared backlog ownership. |
| **Co-Creative → Strategic Partner** | Embed 3SF practices into organizational governance and portfolio planning. |

### Client-Side Application

**Objective:** Ensure the vendor team integrates smoothly into internal structures and delivers business outcomes, not just outputs.

**Client actions**

1. Use this tool during RFP finalization or early discovery.
2. Assign internal ownership for each engagement interface (business, technical, governance).
3. Approve the joint Delivery Charter and participate in the maturity baseline review.
4. Record internal dependencies (e.g., data access, release approvals) in the Governance Matrix.
5. Communicate strategic priorities transparently to enable vendor autonomy.

### Vendor-Side Application

**Objective:** Establish a predictable, value-aligned delivery system and demonstrate partnership maturity from day zero.

**Vendor actions**

1. Facilitate creation of the Engagement Canvas with Client roles.
2. Translate business goals into technical and operational flow diagrams.
3. Identify missing context or misaligned assumptions early and document them.
4. Propose the initial Stable Rules set and verify Client acceptance.
5. Use baseline metrics to plan first 3SF Quarterly Assessment.

### Summary

**Initial Delivery System Design** is the *gateway practice* of 3SF.<br/>
It connects intent to execution by co-creating the first stable delivery system between **Client** and **Vendor**.

The result is a shared **Delivery Charter**, **Engagement Canvas**, and **Maturity Baseline** — forming the foundation for all subsequent 3SF tools and assessments.
