# 3SF Practice Architecture

> *“Theory guides understanding. Practice enables transformation.”*

## Purpose

The **3SF Practice Architecture** explains how to **apply the 3-in-3 SDLC Framework (3SF)** in real projects — for both **Client** and **Vendor** organizations.

While the **theory** defines *why* 3SF exists and *what* it represents, the **practice** defines *how* to use it — *when*, *by whom*, and *for what purpose*.

3SF practices are designed to:

- Help **clients** mature as commissioning and ownership partners.
- Help **vendors** mature as delivery and advisory partners.
- Create a **shared language** between both sides across the full SDLC lifecycle.

## Objectives

- Provide a **map of 3SF usage** across delivery stages and relationship lines.
- Distinguish **client-side** and **vendor-side** applications of each tool.
- Define **modes of application** (Design, Diagnose, Assess, Reflect, Audit, Measure).
- Act as a **navigator** for all practice tools and related training modules.

## Structure of the Practice Part

Each practice is a standalone tool (one file per tool) using a unified template.<br/>
Tools are grouped by **application mode** and mapped to **Client / Vendor** contexts.

| Mode | Primary Focus | Typical User | Example |
|------|----------------|--------------|----------|
| **Design** | Establish delivery & engagement model | Vendor **Delivery Facilitator** / Client **Product Leader** | [Initial Delivery System Design](240-initial-delivery-design.md) |
| **Diagnose** | Reveal constraints and gaps | Vendor **Solution Architect** / Client **Product Leader** | [Delivery System Diagnostic](245-delivery-system-diagnostic.md) |
| **Assess** | Measure project & relationship maturity | **Delivery Facilitator** / **Account Lead** / **Executive Sponsor** | [Quarterly Delivery and Relationship Assessment](250-quarterly-assessment.md) |
| **Reflect** | Enable self-awareness and growth | **Delivery Facilitator**, **Technical Integrator**, **Solution Architect**, **Product Leader** | [Self-Diagnostic and Reflection Tool](255-self-diagnostic.md) |
| **Audit & Aggregate** | Compare and improve across portfolio | **Engineering Director** / **Governance Officer** | [Relationship Audit and Portfolio Maturity Review](260-relationship-audit.md) |
| **Measure** | Consolidate maturity metrics and visualize systemic health | **Governance Officer**, **Account Lead**, **Engineering Director** | [Maturity Dashboard](215-maturity-dashboard.md) |

## Application Modes

| Mode | Typical When | Used by (Client / Vendor) | 3SF Layers Focused | Outcomes |
|------|---------------|---------------------------|--------------------|-----------|
| **Design** | RFP → Kick-off | **Delivery Facilitator** / **Product Leader** | CDL + SRL | Intent and collaboration system established |
| **Diagnose** | Discovery / Early Delivery | **Solution Architect** / **Product Leader** | CDL + SRL | Constraints and dependencies identified |
| **Assess** | Quarterly / Milestone | **Delivery Facilitator** / **Account Lead** / **Executive Sponsor** | SRL + RAC | Delivery and relationship health tracked |
| **Reflect** | Anytime | **Delivery Facilitator**, **Technical Integrator**, **Product Leader** | RAC | Individual or team awareness improved |
| **Audit** | Periodic / Portfolio | **Engineering Director** / **Governance Officer** | CDL + SRL + RAC | Portfolio-level maturity comparison |
| **Measure** | Continuous / Portfolio Governance | **Governance Officer** / **Account Lead** / **Engineering Director** | SRL + RAC | Relationship and maturity data visualized for decision-making |

## Dual-Perspective Application

Each 3SF tool distinguishes **Client View** and **Vendor View**.

| Perspective | Purpose | Typical Roles | Example Application |
|--------------|----------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Client** | Ensure vendor alignment, internal dependencies, and ownership clarity. | **Product Leader**, **Executive Sponsor**, **Vendor Manager** | Use 3SF tools to verify engagement readiness and integration. |
| **Vendor** | Design, execute, and evolve delivery systems that build partnership trust. | **Delivery Facilitator**, **Solution Architect**, **Product Leader** | Use 3SF tools to structure engagements and measure maturity. |
| **Shared (Client + Vendor)** | Strengthen collaboration, feedback, and transparency. | Combined teams across both sides | Apply tools jointly to synchronize relationship evolution. |

Each practice file includes:

> **Client-Side Application** and **Vendor-Side Application** — highlighting respective actions and insights.
> For detailed role definitions, see [Role Responsibility Snapshot](../000-intro/020-role-snapshot.md).

## 3SF Layer Mapping

| 3SF Layer | Purpose | Client-Side Focus | Vendor-Side Focus | Example Tool |
|------------|----------|------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Contextual Drivers Layer (CDL)** | Clarify environment, goals, and constraints | Business objectives & internal readiness | Engagement framing & feasibility | Engagement Context Canvas |
| **Stable Rules Layer (SRL)** | Define repeatable collaboration patterns | Governance & dependencies | Team operations & flow | Autonomy & Control Boundary Charter |
| **Rule Audit Checklist (RAC)** | Reflect and verify maturity | Value realization & partnership signals | Relationship metrics & feedback | Maturity Dashboard / Relationship Audit |

> **Governance & Diagnostics layer:**<br/>
> This layer connects **Practice** and **Theory** through systemic inspection and adaptation.<br/>
> It combines contractual artifacts (see below), the **[Maturity Dashboard](215-maturity-dashboard.md)**, and diagnostics such as<br/>
> **[RAC](../100-theory/130-rule-audit-checklist.md)** and **[CRC](../100-theory/135-contextual-rules-catalog.md)**.<br/>
> Together, they enable transparent governance and maturity measurement across Client and Vendor systems.

## Core Practice Tools – Alignment before Performance

3SF prioritizes **alignment before performance**.<br/>
To ensure that alignment is measurable, the tools below convert 3SF **Principles** into **inspectable artifacts**, enforcing joint ownership across the Client ↔ Vendor boundary.

> The 3SF Practice set follows the systemic order:<br/>
> **Context → Outcome → Trust → Quality → Flow → Accountability → Design → Diagnostics → Assessment → Reflection → Audit → Measurement → Learning.**

### Tools to Expand Core SDLC Practices

| Core SDLC Practice | Tool / Artifact (Mode) | Purpose in 3SF System |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Product Thinking** | [**Outcome-to-Accountability Map**](220-outcome-accountability-map.md) (Design) | Enforces **“Outcome before Output.”** Links business metrics to accountable **Client Product Owner** and responsible **Vendor Product Manager** per SDLC stage. |
| **Architecture & Design** | [**Architectural Trade-Off Contract**](235-architectural-tradeoff-contract.md) (Design / Diagnose) | Formalizes joint design trade-offs and requires sign-off from both **Client** and **Vendor Solution Architects**. Supports **Shared Accountability**. |
| **Engineering & Quality** | [**Shared Definition of Done (DoD) Matrix**](225-shared-definition-of-done.md) (Design) | Defines quality criteria across *Code*, *Operational Readiness*, and *User Acceptance*. |
| **DevOps & Delivery** | [**Flow Constraint Identification**](230-flow-constraint-identification.md) (Diagnose) | Maps flow constraints jointly by **Vendor Delivery Lead** and **Client Project Manager**. |
| **Governance & Risk** | [**Autonomy & Control Boundary Charter**](210-autonomy-control-charter.md) (Design) | Defines decision rights and escalation paths per maturity stage (**Trust before Control**). |
| **Feedback & Learning** | [**Learning Before Blame Protocol**](265-learning-before-blame-protocol.md) (Reflect) | Links issues to violated principles or Stable Rules. Promotes **Learning before Blame**. |

### Tool for the Contextual Drivers Layer (CDL)

| Framework Layer | Tool / Artifact (Mode) | Purpose in 3SF System |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Contextual Drivers Layer** | [**Engagement Context Canvas**](205-engagement-context-canvas.md) (Design / Audit) | Used at the outset of **Discover** stage to define Contextual Drivers and corresponding **Stable Rule Adjustments**. |

## Governance & Diagnostics layer – Contractual Artifacts

While *Core Practices* operationalize 3SF principles within teams, **Contractual Artifacts** define how those principles are enforced **across organizational boundaries**.<br/>
They form the **interface layer** between Client and Vendor, translating *Trust before Control*, *Outcome before Output*, and *Shared Accountability* into measurable, co-signed commitments.

| 3SF Principle | Contractual Artifact | Core SDLC Practice | Primary Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust before Control** | [**Autonomy & Control Boundary Charter**](210-autonomy-control-charter.md) | Governance & Risk | Defines decision rights and escalation boundaries. |
| **Outcome before Output** | [**Outcome-to-Accountability Map**](220-outcome-accountability-map.md) | Product Thinking | Links outcomes to measurable business value jointly owned by Client and Vendor. |
| **Shared Accountability** | [**Architectural Trade-Off Contract**](235-architectural-tradeoff-contract.md) | Architecture & Design | Captures trade-offs with explicit dual sign-off. |

Each artifact is:

- **Bilateral** — co-created and co-signed by matching functional pairs.
- **Inspectable** — verified during maturity assessments and relationship audits.
- **Evolving** — updated as trust and autonomy mature over time.

Together, these artifacts make 3SF the **Meta-Framework of Co-Governance**, bridging strategic intent and operational practice between Client and Vendor.

> **Interpretation:**<br/>
> The Contractual Artifacts act as the **governance bridge** between 3SF Theory and 3SF Practices.<br/>
> They enforce alignment across the Client ↔ Vendor ↔ Product triangle by turning abstract principles into concrete agreements.<br/>
> Without them, collaboration relies on interpretation; with them, collaboration becomes measurable.

## Using Practice Architecture in Training

This file serves as the **starting point** in all training paths:

1. Identify your **side** (Client or Vendor).
2. Determine your **current stage** (RFP, Discovery, Delivery, Post-v1).
3. Choose the **application mode** (Design, Diagnose, Assess, Reflect, Audit).
4. Open the corresponding tool file.
5. Apply it collaboratively using shared terminology and maturity targets.

Training programs and certifications use these mappings to define **3SF Practitioner Paths** — separate for Client and Vendor, but sharing the same conceptual backbone.

## Summary

**3SF Practice Architecture** bridges the *3SF Theory* and the *Practical Toolset*, creating a shared map for both **Client** and **Vendor** teams to:

- Understand *when* and *why* to use each tool. 
- Distinguish respective responsibilities and contributions.
- Build maturity in a synchronized and measurable way.
