# 3SF Practice Architecture

> *“Theory guides understanding. Practice enables transformation.”*

## Purpose

The **3SF Practice Architecture** explains how to **apply the 3-in-3 SDLC Framework (3SF)** in real projects — for both **Client** and **Vendor** organizations.

While the **theory** defines *why* 3SF exists and *what* it represents, the **practice** defines *how* to use it — *when*, *by whom*, and *for what purpose*.

3SF practices are designed to:

- Help **clients** mature as commissioning and ownership partners.
- Help **vendors** mature as delivery and advisory partners.
- Create a **shared language** between both sides across the full SDLC lifecycle.

## Objectives

- Provide a **map of 3SF usage** across delivery stages and relationship lines.
- Distinguish **client-side** and **vendor-side** applications of each tool.
- Define **modes of application** (Design, Diagnose, Assess, Reflect, Audit, Measure).
- Act as a **navigator** for all practice tools and related training modules.

## Structure of the Practice Part

Each practice is a standalone tool (one file per tool) using a unified template.<br/>
Tools are grouped by **application mode** and mapped to **client / vendor contexts**.

| Mode | Primary Focus | Typical User | Example |
|------|----------------|---------------|----------|
| **Design** | Establish delivery & engagement model | Vendor **Delivery Facilitator** / Client **Product Leader** | [Initial Delivery System Design](240-initial-delivery-design.md) |
| **Diagnose** | Reveal constraints and gaps | Vendor **Solution Architect** / Client **Product Leader** | [Delivery System Diagnostic](245-delivery-system-diagnostic.md) |
| **Assess** | Measure project & relationship maturity | **Delivery Facilitator** / **Account Lead** / **Executive Sponsor** | [Quarterly Delivery and Relationship Assessment](250-quarterly-assessment.md) |
| **Reflect** | Enable self-awareness and growth | **Delivery Facilitator**, **Technical Integrator**, **Solution Architect**, **Product Leader** | [Self-Diagnostic and Reflection Tool](255-self-diagnostic.md) |
| **Audit & Aggregate** | Compare and improve across portfolio | **Engineering Director** / **Governance Officer** | [Relationship Audit and Portfolio Maturity Review](260-relationship-audit.md) |
| **Measure** | Consolidate maturity metrics and visualize systemic health | **Governance Officer**, **Account Lead**, **Engineering Director** | [Maturity Dashboard and Metrics Consolidation](265-maturity-dashboard.md) |

## Dual-Perspective Application

Each 3SF tool distinguishes **Client View** and **Vendor View**:

| Perspective | Purpose | Typical Roles | Example Application |
|--------------|----------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Client** | Ensure vendor alignment, internal dependencies, and ownership clarity. | **Product Leader**, **Executive Sponsor**, **Vendor Manager** | Use 3SF tools to verify engagement readiness and integration. |
| **Vendor** | Design, execute, and evolve delivery systems that build partnership trust. | **Delivery Facilitator**, **Solution Architect**, **Product Leader** | Use 3SF tools to structure engagements and measure maturity. |
| **Shared (Client + Vendor)** | Strengthen collaboration, feedback, and transparency. | Combined teams across both sides | Apply tools jointly to synchronize relationship evolution. |

Each practice file includes sections:

> **Client-Side Application** and **Vendor-Side Application**, highlighting respective actions and insights.

## Application Modes

| Mode | Typical When | Used by (Client / Vendor) | 3SF Layers Focused | Outcomes |
|------|---------------|---------------------------|--------------------|-----------|
| **Design** | RFP → Kick-off | **Delivery Facilitator** / **Product Leader** | CDL + SRL | Intent and collaboration system established |
| **Diagnose** | Discovery / Early Delivery | **Solution Architect** / **Product Leader** | CDL + SRL | Constraints and dependencies identified |
| **Assess** | Quarterly / Milestone | **Delivery Facilitator** / **Account Lead** / **Executive Sponsor** | SRL + RAC | Delivery and relationship health tracked |
| **Reflect** | Anytime | **Delivery Facilitator**, **Technical Integrator**, **Product Leader** | RAC | Individual or team awareness improved |
| **Audit** | Periodic / Portfolio | **Engineering Director** / **Governance Officer** | CDL + SRL + RAC | Portfolio-level maturity comparison |
| **Measure** | Continuous / Portfolio Governance | **Governance Officer** / **Account Lead** / **Engineering Director** | SRL + RAC | Relationship and maturity data visualized for decision-making |

|------------|----------|------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Contextual Drivers Layer (CDL)** | Clarify environment, goals, and constraints | Business objectives & internal readiness | Engagement framing & feasibility | Initial Delivery Design |
| **Stable Rules Layer (SRL)** | Define repeatable collaboration patterns | Governance & dependencies | Team operations & flow | Delivery System Diagnostic |
| **Rule Audit Checklist (RAC)** | Reflect and verify maturity | Value realization & partnership signals | Relationship metrics & feedback | Self-Diagnostic / Relationship Audit |

## Expanding SDLC Practices – Alignment over Execution

3SF prioritizes **alignment before performance**.<br/>
To ensure that alignment is not aspirational but measurable, the following tools extend the six core SDLC practices and convert 3SF **Principles** into **mandatory, inspectable artifacts**.<br/>
They enforce joint ownership across the Client ↔ Vendor boundary and make theoretical concepts operational.

### Tools to Expand the Six Core SDLC Practices

| Core SDLC Practice | Tool/Artifact (Mode) | Purpose in 3SF System |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Product Thinking** | [**Outcome-to-Accountability Map**](215-outcome-accountability-map.md) (Design) | Enforces the **"Outcome before Output"** principle. Maps specific business metrics (outcomes) to the accountable **Client Product Owner** and the responsible **Vendor Product Manager** for each SDLC stage. Prevents the client from handing off a requirement without co-owning the result. |
| **Architecture & Design** | [**Architectural Trade-Off Contract**](235-architectural-tradeoff-contract.md) (Design/Diagnose) | Formalizes joint decisions. Documents critical non-functional requirement (NFR) trade-offs (e.g., speed vs. cost, security vs. complexity) and requires explicit sign-off from both **Client Solution Architect** and **Vendor Solution Architect**. Directly supports **Shared Accountability**. |
| **Engineering & Quality** | [**Shared Definition of Done (DoD) Matrix**](225-shared-definition-of-done.md) (Design) | Moves the **Validate** stage beyond simple client sign-off. Defines quality criteria across three dimensions: *Code Quality* (Vendor responsibility), *Operational Readiness* (Client Technical Integrator responsibility), and *User Acceptance* (Client Product Owner responsibility). |
| **DevOps & Delivery** | [**Flow Constraint Identification**](230-flow-constraint-identification.md) (Diagnose) | Used by the **Vendor Delivery Lead** and **Client Project Manager** to collaboratively map the flow (Value Stream Mapping) and identify the **top 3 systemic constraints** (e.g., Client security review time, Vendor environment provisioning). Directly supports **"Flow before Speed."** |
| **Governance & Risk** | [**Autonomy & Control Boundary Charter**](220-autonomy-control-charter.md) (Design) | Essential for **"Trust before Control."** Defines explicit decision rights based on the current **Maturity Level**. E.g., at *Transactional Trust*, the Vendor needs approval for changes >1 day effort; at *Strategic Partnership*, the Vendor reports changes >5 days effort. This makes the boundary measurable. |
| **Feedback & Learning** | [**"Learning Before Blame" Protocol**](270-learning-before-blame-protocol.md) (Reflect) | A structured retrospective guide for the **Evolve** stage. Forces teams to analyze system friction by asking: (1) What was the *systemic* cause? (2) What *principle* was violated? (3) What **Stable Rule** should we audit? Prevents the system from defaulting to **The Scapegoat Culture**. |

### Tool for the Contextual Drivers Layer (CDL)

| Framework Layer | Tool/Artifact (Mode) | Purpose in 3SF System |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Contextual Drivers Layer** | [**Engagement Context Canvas**](210-engagement-context-canvas.md) (Design/Audit) | A structured canvas used at the outset of the **Discover** stage. It requires both sides to explicitly define the six Contextual Drivers (Commercial, Regulatory, Architectural, etc.) and agree on the corresponding **Stable Rule Adjustments**. This prevents the core issue of a **Client Vendor Manager** imposing a rigid process when the context (e.g., highly experimental scope) demands flexibility. |

## Cross-Organizational Application Layer – Contractual Artifacts

While the *Alignment-over-Execution* tools operationalize 3SF Principles within delivery teams, the **Contractual Artifacts** define how those Principles are enforced **across organizational boundaries**.

These artifacts form the **interface layer** between Client and Vendor organizations — transforming principles such as *Trust before Control*, *Outcome before Output*, and *Shared Accountability* into measurable, co-signed commitments.

They are used as annexes or attachments to the **Delivery Charter** and act as the daily governance instruments of the 3SF operating system.

| 3SF Principle | Contractual Artifact | Core SDLC Practice | Primary Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trust before Control** | [**Autonomy & Control Boundary Charter**](220-autonomy-control-charter.md) | Governance & Risk | Defines decision-making rights and escalation boundaries based on relationship maturity level. |
| **Outcome before Output** | [**Outcome-to-Accountability Map**](215-outcome-accountability-map.md) | Product Thinking | Connects each delivery goal to a measurable business outcome jointly owned by Client and Vendor. |
| **Shared Accountability** | [**Architectural Trade-Off Contract**](235-architectural-tradeoff-contract.md) | Architecture & Design | Formalizes key technical and non-functional trade-offs with explicit sign-off from both Solution Architects. |

Each artifact is:

- **Bilateral** — co-created and co-signed by corresponding functional pairs.
- **Inspectable** — verified during maturity assessments and relationship audits.
- **Evolving** — updated as trust and autonomy mature over time.

Together, these artifacts make 3SF the **Meta-Framework of Co-Governance**, bridging strategic intent and operational practice between Client and Vendor organizations.

> **Interpretation:**<br/>
> The Contractual Artifacts act as the **governance bridge** between 3SF Theory and 3SF Practices.<br/>
> They enforce alignment across the Client ↔ Vendor ↔ Product triangle by turning abstract principles into concrete agreements.<br/>
> Without them, collaboration relies on interpretation; with them, collaboration becomes measurable.

## 3SF Functional Role Model

### Purpose

The Functional Role Model defines how both Client and Vendor teams participate in the SDLC system described by 3SF.<br/>
It establishes a shared functional language across all practices, enabling consistent use of roles in the Practice documents.<br/>
Roles are defined by their **system function**, not organizational title, and may exist on either side depending on engagement setup.

### Co-Dependent SDLC System Functions

These are the core **joint execution functions** that drive the SDLC. They are necessary for managing the **Client ↔ Vendor ↔ Product** relationships.

| Functional Core | Purpose (Joint SDLC Management) | Composite Name Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Product Leader** | Owns *What* (Value) and *How* (Solution Strategy). | Client Product Owner / Vendor Product Manager |
| **Delivery Facilitator** | Owns *Flow*, removes impediments, and manages *systemic friction*. | Client Project Manager / Vendor Delivery Lead |
| **Solution Architect** | Owns *Coherence*, structural integrity, and architectural *trade-offs*. | Client Solution Architect / Vendor Solution Architect |
| **Technical Integrator** | Owns *Technical Execution*, operational readiness, and integration *quality*. | Client Technical Integrator / Vendor Technical Integrator |
| **Requirements Analyst** | Owns *Clarity*, domain expertise, and the *translation* of business needs. | Client Requirements Analyst / Vendor Requirements Analyst |
| **Experience Designer** | Owns *Usability*, user needs, and the design that enables **Outcome before Output**. | Client Experience Lead / Vendor Experience Lead |

### Client-Specific Fixed Cores

These roles provide the **governance, funding, and boundaries** for the engagement.

| Functional Core (Client-Only) | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Executive Sponsor** | Owns funding, strategic intent, and the highest-level **Trust before Control** decisions. |
| **Vendor Manager** | Owns commercial agreements, contracting, and performance against the **Maturity Model**. |
| **Governance Officer** | Owns adherence to regulatory, security, and internal audit standards. |

### Vendor-Specific Fixed Cores

These roles provide the **organizational capacity, quality assurance, and commercial stewardship** needed to sustain the partnership.

| Functional Core (Vendor-Only) | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Account Lead** | Owns the overall commercial health and portfolio alignment for the client relationship. |
| **Engineering Director** | Manages resource capacity, staff health, and supports the delivery unit's **systemic maturity**. |
| **Practice Lead** | Defines and upholds quality standards for specific disciplines (e.g., Architecture, DevEx, QA, DevOps). |
| **Engineering Specialist** | The core capacity responsible for hands-on technical implementation and verification. |

### Summary of Dimensions

1. **Co-Dependent System Roles** – the joint actors of the SDLC.
2. **Client Governance & Sponsorship Roles** – the structural boundary setters.
3. **Vendor Capacity & Stewardship Roles** – the structural sustainers.

## Practice Template

Each individual practice file follows this shared structure:

| Section | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Purpose** | Why the tool exists and what maturity gap it closes |
| **Applies To** | SDLC stage, relationship line, and maturity level |
| **Actors / Roles** | Client + Vendor roles involved (see Functional Role Model) |
| **Steps / Routines** | How to apply it collaboratively |
| **Inputs / Outputs** | Artifacts or agreements produced |
| **Metrics / Signals** | Quantitative and qualitative indicators |

## Using Practice Architecture in Training

This file serves as the **starting point** in all training paths:

1. Identify your **side** (Client or Vendor).
2. Determine your **current stage** (RFP, Discovery, Delivery, Post-v1).
3. Choose the **application mode** (Design, Diagnose, Assess, Reflect, Audit).
4. Open the corresponding tool file.
5. Apply it collaboratively using shared terminology and maturity targets.

Training programs and certifications use these mappings to define **3SF Practitioner Paths** — separate for Client and Vendor, but sharing the same conceptual backbone.

## Summary

**3SF Practice Architecture** bridges the *3SF Theory* and the *Practical Toolset*, creating a shared map for both **Client** and **Vendor** teams to:

- Understand *when* and *why* to use each tool,
- Distinguish respective responsibilities and contributions,
- Build maturity in a synchronized and measurable way.
