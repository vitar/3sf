# 3SF Practice Architecture

> *“Theory guides understanding. Practice enables transformation.”*

## Purpose

The **3SF Practice Architecture** explains how to **apply the 3-in-3 SDLC Framework (3SF)** in real projects — for both **Client** and **Vendor** organizations.

While the **theory** defines *why* 3SF exists and *what* it represents, the **practice** defines *how* to use it — *when*, *by whom*, and *for what purpose*.

3SF practices are designed to:

- Help **clients** mature as commissioning and ownership partners.
- Help **vendors** mature as delivery and advisory partners.
- Create a **shared language** between both sides across the full SDLC lifecycle.

## Ubjectives

- Provide a **map of 3SF usage** across delivery stages and relationship lines.
- Distinguish **client-side** and **vendor-side** applications of each tool.
- Define **modes of application** (Design, Diagnose, Assess, Reflect, Audit).
- Act as a **navigator** for all practice tools and related training modules.

## Structure of the Practice Part

Each practice is a standalone tool (one file per tool) using a unified template.<br/>
Tools are grouped by **application mode** and mapped to **client/vendor contexts**.

| Range | Mode | Primary Focus | Typical User | Example |
|-------|------|----------------|---------------|----------|
| 210–219 | **Design** | Establish delivery & engagement model | Vendor Delivery Lead / Client PM | Initial Delivery System Design |
| 220–229 | **Diagnose** | Reveal constraints and gaps | Vendor Architect / Client Product Owner | Delivery System Diagnostic |
| 230–239 | **Assess** | Measure project & relationship maturity | Project Lead / Account Lead / Client Sponsor | Quarterly Project Assessment |
| 240–249 | **Reflect** | Enable self-awareness and growth | PL, PM, TL, Architect, Client Manager | Self-Diagnostic Tool |
| 250–259 | **Audit & Aggregate** | Compare and improve across portfolio | Studio Lead / Client Governance | Relationship Audit & Portfolio Dashboard |

## Dual-Perspective Application

Each 3SF tool distinguishes **Client View** and **Vendor View**:

| Perspective | Purpose | Typical Roles | Example Application |
|--------------|----------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Client** | Ensure vendor alignment, internal dependencies, and ownership clarity. | Product Owner, Client PM, Business Sponsor | Use 3SF tools to verify engagement readiness and integration. |
| **Vendor** | Design, execute, and evolve delivery systems that build partnership trust. | Delivery Lead, Project Lead, Architect | Use 3SF tools to structure engagements and measure maturity. |
| **Shared (Client + Vendor)** | Strengthen collaboration, feedback, and transparency. | Combined teams | Apply tools jointly to synchronize relationship evolution. |

Each tool file will include sections:

> **Client-Side Application** and **Vendor-Side Application**, highlighting respective actions and insights.

## Application Modes

| Mode | Typical When | Used by (Client / Vendor) | 3SF Layers Focused | Outcomes |
|------|---------------|---------------------------|--------------------|-----------|
| **Design** | RFP → Kick-off | Delivery Lead / Client PM | CDL + SRL | Intent and collaboration system established |
| **Diagnose** | Discovery / Early Delivery | Discovery Lead / Product Owner | CDL + SRL | Constraints and dependencies identified |
| **Assess** | Quarterly / Milestone | PL / Account Lead / Sponsor | SRL + RAC | Delivery and relationship health tracked |
| **Reflect** | Anytime | PL / PM / TL / Client Manager | RAC | Individual or team awareness improved |
| **Audit** | Periodic / Portfolio | Studio Lead / Client Governance | CDL + SRL + RAC | Portfolio-level maturity comparison |

## Lifecycle Navigation

| **When** | **Mode** | **Tool (File)** | **Client Role(s)** | **Vendor Role(s)** | **Outcome** |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------|
| RFP / Pre-Engagement | Design | `210-initial-delivery-design.md` | Sponsor, PM | Delivery Lead, Presales | Shared engagement model & maturity baseline |
| Small Team Discovery | Diagnose | `220-delivery-system-diagnostic.md` | Product Owner | Architect, PL | Validated context and delivery readiness |
| Kick-off | Design | `210-initial-delivery-design.md` | PM, Sponsor | PL, Delivery Lead | Clear interfaces and governance rules |
| Ongoing Delivery (MVP → v1) | Assess | `230-quarterly-assessment.md` | PM, Product Owner | PL, Account Lead | Relationship and flow monitored |
| Anytime | Reflect | `240-self-diagnostic.md` | Client Lead | PL, TL | Personal or team growth insight |
| Post-v1 / Portfolio | Audit | `250-relationship-audit.md` | Sponsor, Governance | Delivery Lead, Studio Lead | Lessons learned & next-stage maturity targets |

## 3SF Layer Mapping

| 3SF Layer | Purpose | Client-Side Focus | Vendor-Side Focus | Example Tool |
|------------|----------|------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Contextual Drivers Layer (CDL)** | Clarify environment, goals, and constraints | Business objectives & internal readiness | Engagement framing & feasibility | Initial Delivery Design |
| **Stable Rules Layer (SRL)** | Define repeatable collaboration patterns | Governance & dependencies | Team operations & flow | Delivery System Diagnostic |
| **Rule Audit Checklist (RAC)** | Reflect and verify maturity | Value realization & partnership signals | Relationship metrics & feedback | Self-Diagnostic / Relationship Audit |

## Practice Template

Each individual practice file follows this shared structure:

| Section | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Purpose** | Why the tool exists and what maturity gap it closes |
| **Applies To** | SDLC stage, relationship line, and maturity level |
| **Actors / Roles** | Client + Vendor roles involved |
| **Steps / Routines** | How to apply it collaboratively |
| **Inputs / Outputs** | Artifacts or agreements produced |
| **Metrics / Signals** | Quantitative and qualitative indicators |
| **Common Pitfalls** | Typical misuses or blind spots |
| **Scaling Notes** | How to evolve use with maturity |
| **Client-Side Application** | Specific guidance for client users |
| **Vendor-Side Application** | Specific guidance for vendor users |

## Using Practice Architecture in Training

This file serves as the **starting point** in all training paths:

1. Identify your **side** (Client or Vendor).
2. Determine your **current stage** (RFP, Discovery, Delivery, Post-v1).
3. Choose the **application mode** (Design, Diagnose, Assess, Reflect, Audit).
4. Open the corresponding tool file (210–259).
5. Apply it collaboratively using shared terminology and maturity targets.

Training programs and certifications will use these mappings to define
**3SF Practitioner Paths** — separate for Client and Vendor, but sharing the same conceptual backbone.

## Summary

**3SF Practice Architecture** bridges the *3SF Theory* and the *Practical Toolset*, creating a shared map for both **Client** and **Vendor** teams to:

- Understand *when* and *why* to use each tool,
- Distinguish respective responsibilities and contributions,
- Build maturity in a synchronized and measurable way.
