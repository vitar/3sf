# Maturity Dashboard and Metrics Consolidation

> *“You can’t manage trust, but you can observe its signals.”*

### Purpose

The **3SF Maturity Dashboard** aggregates data and insights from all 3SF practices into a single view of **delivery health**, **relationship quality**, and **value realization** across projects or portfolios.

It enables both **Client** and **Vendor** organizations to:

- Track the evolution of maturity across **Engagement**, **Delivery**, and **Value** lines,
- Identify systemic patterns, strengths, and weaknesses,
- Support decision-making with evidence rather than perception.

This tool transforms qualitative insights from Diagnostics, Assessments, and Audits into **measurable governance intelligence**.

### Applies To

| Dimension | Scope |
|------------|-------|
| **SDLC Stages** | Active delivery and portfolio governance |
| **3SF Relationship Lines** | Engagement ↔ Delivery ↔ Value |
| **3SF Layers** | Stable Rules Layer (SRL) + Rule Audit Checklist (RAC) |
| **Maturity Target** | Continuous visibility across all maturity stages |

### Actors / Roles

| Client Side | Vendor Side | Shared Purpose |
|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Executive Sponsor** | **Account Lead** | Use dashboard to align strategy and investment with maturity progress. |
| **Governance Officer** | **Engineering Director** | Manage compliance, performance, and improvement initiatives. |
| **Product Leader** | **Delivery Facilitator** | Use dashboard insights for quarterly planning and team health reviews. |
| **Solution Architect**, **Technical Integrator** | **Solution Architect**, **Practice Lead** | Analyze technical and process health trends across engagements. |

### Steps / Routines

1. **Collect Maturity Data**
   - Gather scores and narratives from all **Diagnostics**, **Quarterly Assessments**, **Self-Diagnostics**, and **Audits**.
   - For each relationship line (Engagement, Delivery, Value), capture:
     - Current maturity level (1–5 scale)
     - Trend (improving, stable, declining)
     - Confidence (high, medium, low)

2. **Aggregate and Visualize**
   - Create a visual matrix (projects on X-axis, relationship lines on Y-axis).
   - Use color or symbol codes for maturity levels and trends.
   - Optional: combine multiple clients or vendors for benchmarking.

3. **Analyze Patterns**
   - Identify correlations (e.g., strong Delivery maturity often predicts Value growth).
   - Detect portfolio hotspots where engagement maturity lags behind delivery performance.
   - Cross-reference with improvement backlogs for progress validation.

4. **Publish Insights**
   - Generate **Maturity Dashboard Summary** with key observations and recommendations.
   - Include:
     - Top strengths to preserve,
     - Systemic gaps to address,
     - Maturity evolution graph by quarter.
   - Share dashboard in portfolio review or governance sessions.

5. **Integrate into Decision Loops**
   - Use maturity trends to prioritize leadership coaching, governance improvements, or funding adjustments.
   - Embed dashboard checkpoints into regular 3SF review cycles.

### Inputs / Outputs

| Inputs | Outputs |
|---------|----------|
| Maturity data from all 3SF tools (210–250), Improvement Backlogs, Relationship Audit reports | **Maturity Dashboard (visual + tabular)**, **Trend Analysis Summary**, **Portfolio Health Overview** |

### Metrics / Signals

| Category | Example Indicators |
|-----------|--------------------|
| **Engagement Maturity Index (EMI)** | Average score across all active projects for Engagement line. |
| **Delivery Maturity Index (DMI)** | Average Delivery line score adjusted by predictability and flow metrics. |
| **Value Maturity Index (VMI)** | Proportion of delivered outputs linked to measurable outcomes. |
| **Partnership Confidence Index (PCI)** | Combined sentiment from client and vendor quarterly surveys. |
| **Maturity Velocity (MV)** | Rate of improvement (+/– maturity points per quarter). |
| **Systemic Risk Ratio (SRR)** | Percentage of projects with declining maturity for 2+ quarters. |

### Common Pitfalls

- Treating the dashboard as a performance scorecard instead of **a learning compass**.
- Aggregating numeric scores without including qualitative narratives.
- Lack of shared ownership between client and vendor in maintaining data accuracy.
- Inconsistent maturity definitions across teams.
- Focusing on individual project issues instead of systemic patterns.

### Scaling Notes

| Maturity Stage | Evolution Focus |
|----------------|-----------------|
| **Collaborative → Co-Creative** | Track maturity across multiple teams or products. |
| **Co-Creative → Strategic Partner** | Integrate dashboard into quarterly executive reviews. |
| **Strategic → Integrated Partnership** | Automate dashboard updates and use them for strategic planning. |

At high maturity, the dashboard becomes part of enterprise reporting — linking relationship quality directly to business outcomes.

### Client-Side Application

**Objective:** Use the dashboard to align business value realization and governance oversight with real relationship maturity data.

**Client actions**
1. Assign a **Governance Officer** to own dashboard updates and review cadence.
2. Correlate maturity trends with business metrics (ROI, adoption, satisfaction).
3. Share insights with executive sponsors to guide sourcing and portfolio investment.
4. Use findings to improve vendor enablement and internal dependency management.

### Vendor-Side Application

**Objective:** Use the dashboard as evidence of maturity growth, delivery reliability, and partnership accountability.

**Vendor actions**

1. Aggregate project-level maturity data quarterly under the **Account Lead**.
2. Use insights for portfolio retrospectives and client presentations.
3. Correlate maturity signals with delivery performance (e.g., predictability, defect rate).
4. Share dashboard visuals during Relationship Audits and executive check-ins.
5. Translate trends into training, hiring, and playbook improvements.

### Summary

The **3SF Maturity Dashboard** is the measurement layer connecting all 3SF tools into a living system of governance intelligence.<br/>
It replaces anecdotal reporting with a **shared, evidence-based understanding** of partnership maturity — bridging data, dialogue, and decision-making.

When used consistently, it turns 3SF from a set of practices into a **maturity management ecosystem** — allowing both Client and Vendor organizations to see, learn, and evolve together.
