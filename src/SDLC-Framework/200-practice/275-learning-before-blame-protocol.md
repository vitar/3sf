# Learning Before Blame Protocol

> *“When things go wrong, the system failed — not the people.”*

## Purpose

The **Learning Before Blame Protocol (LBP)** institutionalizes the 3SF principle **“Learning before Blame.”**<br/>
It provides a structured, repeatable process for analyzing incidents, delivery issues, or failed outcomes in a way that produces **systemic improvement**, not **personal defense**.

This tool helps Client and Vendor teams:

- Identify the *systemic causes* of breakdowns rather than individual mistakes,
- Trace problems back to violated **3SF Principles** or missing **Stable Rules**,
- Record actionable learnings for inclusion in the next **Quarterly Assessment** or **Relationship Audit**.

LBP shifts post-mortem discussions from *accountability theater* to *continuous learning* — strengthening trust and resilience.

## Applies To

| Dimension | Scope |
|------------|-------|
| **SDLC Stages** | Evolve → Operate → Improve |
| **3SF Relationship Lines** | Delivery ↔ Value ↔ Engagement |
| **3SF Layers** | Rule Audit Checklist (RAC) |
| **Maturity Target** | From *Collaborative Confidence* → toward *Co-Creative Trust* |

## Actors / Roles

| Client Side | Vendor Side | Shared Purpose |
|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Product Leader** | **Delivery Facilitator** | Jointly lead reflection and improvement actions. |
| **Governance Officer** | **Engineering Director** | Capture compliance, risk, and systemic learnings. |
| **Solution Architect** | **Technical Integrator** | Identify and document technical or process root causes. |
| **Executive Sponsor** | **Account Lead** | Approve and track cross-project improvement themes. |

## Steps / Routines

1. **Trigger the Protocol**
   - Initiate LBP when a significant delivery issue, incident, or client concern occurs.
   - The Delivery Facilitator ensures the conversation happens *within 48 hours* of detection.

2. **Set the Stage for Psychological Safety**
   - Remind all participants: *The purpose is learning, not assigning blame.*
   - Use a neutral facilitator (Delivery Facilitator or Product Leader).
   - Prohibit discussion of individual performance or disciplinary matters.

3. **Collect System Facts**
   - Gather objective data: timeline, metrics, dependencies, decisions.
   - Document the sequence of events without interpretation or emotion.

4. **Analyze Through the 3SF Lens**
   - Ask the three guiding questions:
     1. *What was the systemic cause?*
     2. *Which 3SF Principle was violated or missing?*
     3. *Which Stable Rule (SRL) should we review or strengthen?*
   - Tag findings by **Relationship Line** (Engagement, Delivery, Value).

5. **Define Learning Outcomes**
   - Identify 2–3 specific learning insights per event.
   - Translate insights into preventive actions or SRL updates.

6. **Publish and Integrate**
   - Record the session output as a **Learning Summary** with lessons learned, actions, and owners.
   - Feed learnings into the next **Quarterly Assessment** or **Relationship Audit**.

## Inputs / Outputs

| Inputs | Outputs |
|---------|----------|
| Incident reports, delivery metrics, retrospective notes | **Learning Summary**, **Stable Rule Adjustment Record**, updated **Improvement Backlog** |

## Metrics / Signals

| Category | Example Indicators |
|-----------|--------------------|
| **Response Speed** | 100% of critical incidents trigger LBP within 48 hours. |
| **Systemic Action Ratio** | ≥ 80% of actions focus on system/process, not individuals. |
| **Learning Retention** | Learnings tracked and reused in ≥ 2 subsequent retrospectives. |
| **Psychological Safety Signal** | Team survey rating ≥ 4/5 for safety during LBP sessions. |

## Common Pitfalls

- Conducting sessions reactively instead of routinely.
- Allowing implicit blame through tone or question framing.
- Producing long “root cause” documents without actionable learning.
- Failing to connect learnings to 3SF layers (Principles → Rules → Practice).
- Not following up on agreed improvement actions.

## Scaling Notes

| Maturity Stage | Evolution Focus |
|----------------|-----------------|
| **Collaborative → Co-Creative** | Make LBP a recurring part of retrospectives. |
| **Co-Creative → Strategic Partner** | Aggregate learning patterns in portfolio-level Relationship Audits. |

At higher maturity, LBP evolves into a **learning culture protocol** embedded across all client-vendor engagements.

## Client-Side Application

**Objective:** Promote systemic learning inside the client organization and demonstrate fairness in accountability.

**Client actions**

1. Participate in LBP sessions as an equal partner, not a judge.
2. Identify internal system gaps contributing to delivery friction.
3. Integrate lessons learned into internal process improvement cycles.
4. Encourage vendor transparency by rewarding openness over defense.

## Vendor-Side Application

**Objective:** Reinforce accountability through openness and solution-oriented communication.

**Vendor actions**

1. Trigger LBP proactively when issues arise.
2. Provide factual evidence and context without defensiveness.
3. Co-author the Learning Summary and improvement backlog entries.
4. Share learnings across teams to avoid repeated systemic issues.

## Summary

The **Learning Before Blame Protocol** institutionalizes a culture of transparency, fairness, and systemic thinking.<br/>
It ensures that every failure strengthens the partnership — transforming incidents into structured learning opportunities.<br/>
When both Client and Vendor adopt this mindset, **trust becomes renewable**, and **maturity becomes measurable.**
