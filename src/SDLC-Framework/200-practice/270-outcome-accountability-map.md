# Outcome-to-Accountability Map

> *“Every output without a shared outcome erodes trust.”*

## Purpose

The **Outcome-to-Accountability Map (OAM)** enforces the 3SF principle **“Outcome before Output.”**
It ensures that every deliverable is linked to a clearly defined **business outcome** that both Client and Vendor jointly own.

This tool converts intent into accountability by:

- Connecting **business metrics** (outcomes) with **delivery metrics** (outputs),
- Assigning **accountability** to the Client Product Owner (value realization) and **responsibility** to the Vendor Product Manager (delivery results),
- Making both sides jointly accountable for success beyond completion.

OAM closes the gap between *client expectations* and *vendor execution*, establishing measurable value ownership before delivery starts.

## Applies To

| Dimension | Scope |
|------------|-------|
| **SDLC Stages** | Discovery → Design → Delivery |
| **3SF Relationship Lines** | Value ↔ Engagement ↔ Delivery |
| **3SF Layers** | Contextual Drivers Layer (CDL) + Stable Rules Layer (SRL) |
| **Maturity Target** | From *Transactional Trust* → toward *Collaborative Confidence* |

## Actors / Roles

| Client Side | Vendor Side | Shared Purpose |
|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Product Leader (Client Product Owner)** | **Product Leader (Vendor Product Manager)** | Define and co-own success metrics. |
| **Executive Sponsor** | **Account Lead** | Approve business alignment and outcome definitions. |
| **Requirements Analyst** | **Solution Architect** | Ensure traceability between outcome, requirement, and implementation. |
| **Governance Officer** | **Delivery Facilitator** | Validate that outcome accountability is reflected in reporting and dashboards. |

## Steps / Routines

1. **Define Core Outcomes**
   - Identify 3–5 primary outcomes representing *business impact*, not *features delivered*.
   - Example outcomes: *increase conversion by 5%*, *reduce support time by 30%*, *enable compliance with X standard*.

2. **Map Outcome-to-Output Chain**
   - For each outcome, list supporting epics or deliverables.
   - Link each epic to outcome metric(s) and designate:
     - **Accountable (Client)** – ensures outcome adoption.
     - **Responsible (Vendor)** – ensures delivery of the enabling feature.

3. **Assign Verification Method**
   - Define how each outcome will be measured (data source, time window, owner).
   - Document agreed-upon baseline and target values.

4. **Validate Accountability Balance**
   - Review across roles — ensure no outcome is owned by only one side.
   - The Delivery Facilitator confirms workload balance and alignment.

5. **Approve and Publish**
   - Present the OAM in the **Initial Delivery System Design** workshop or early discovery.
   - Both Executive Sponsor and Account Lead sign off.
   - Store in the shared Delivery Charter repository.

6. **Revisit During Quarterly Assessment**
   - Track outcome progress alongside delivery metrics.
   - Adjust accountability mapping if team composition or ownership changes.

## Inputs / Outputs

| Inputs | Outputs |
|---------|----------|
| Business objectives, backlog epics, KPIs | **Outcome-to-Accountability Map**, baseline and target metrics, accountability matrix integrated into Delivery Charter |

## Metrics / Signals

| Category | Example Indicators |
|-----------|--------------------|
| **Outcome Traceability** | 100% of major epics linked to at least one measurable outcome. |
| **Ownership Clarity** | Each outcome has both a Client and Vendor owner. |
| **Value Adoption Rate** | ≥ 70% of delivered outcomes meet or exceed baseline targets within 3 months. |
| **Engagement Maturity Signal** | Increased alignment between product metrics and delivery cadence. |

## Common Pitfalls

- Confusing *outputs* (features) with *outcomes* (impact).
- Allowing one-sided ownership — e.g., only vendor responsible for outcomes.
- Using vanity KPIs (story points, release counts) instead of real value metrics.
- Neglecting to update accountability when team composition or priorities change.
- Omitting baselines — making success impossible to measure.

## Scaling Notes

| Maturity Stage | Evolution Focus |
|----------------|-----------------|
| **Transactional → Collaborative** | Introduce shared success metrics in statements of work. |
| **Collaborative → Co-Creative** | Integrate outcome metrics into backlog prioritization. |
| **Co-Creative → Strategic Partner** | Shift governance reviews from output completion to outcome realization. |

## Client-Side Application

**Objective:** Maintain value ownership and prevent delegation of accountability to the vendor.

**Client actions**

1. Lead outcome definition with input from stakeholders.
2. Assign clear accountability for each outcome to internal business or product owners. 
3. Validate that vendor outputs map to business goals.
4. Review outcome progress during Quarterly Assessments.

## Vendor-Side Application

**Objective:** Align delivery execution to business value and demonstrate accountability maturity.

**Vendor actions**

1. Support outcome framing and confirm technical feasibility.
2. Map features and epics to defined outcomes using the OAM template.
3. Report progress based on impact, not just delivery completion.
4. Use OAM data to inform retrospective discussions and maturity assessments.

## Summary

The **Outcome-to-Accountability Map** is the keystone artifact enforcing **Outcome before Output**.<br/>
It transforms expectations into shared accountability — ensuring that every output contributes to measurable, co-owned business results.<br/>
Applied consistently, OAM strengthens alignment, accelerates trust, and prevents the “handover mentality” at the root of failed client–vendor partnerships.
