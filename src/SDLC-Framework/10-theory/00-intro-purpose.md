# 3-in-3 SDLC Framework (3SF)

## Introduction

The **3-in-3 SDLC Framework** — or **3SF** — is a relationship-aware software delivery framework that unites **client**, **vendor**, and **product/service** into one coherent system of collaboration.<br/>
It was created to help organizations design, execute, and evolve delivery systems that are **aligned, predictable, and continuously learning**, regardless of project type or commercial model.

Where most delivery frameworks describe *what happens inside a vendor organization*, 3SF explains **how success depends on the relationship between all three system elements** — *Client ↔ Vendor ↔ Product* — and how alignment across them determines value realization.

## Purpose

The 3SF was designed to:

- **Connect strategy and delivery** by translating goals, constraints, and context into practical delivery configurations.
- **Expose and close maturity gaps** between client and vendor through shared understanding of responsibilities and decision-making.
- **Balance structure and adaptability** — combining predictable delivery with continuous learning and feedback.
- **Enable contextual decision-making** — showing how commercial, organizational, and technical drivers shape the right delivery approach.
- **Build partnership maturity** over time, turning transactional engagements into strategic collaborations.

It serves both as:

1. **A delivery design framework** — guiding how to configure projects before execution.
2. **A diagnostic tool** — helping leaders assess delivery health and identify systemic improvements.
3. **A learning model** — supporting continuous improvement and leadership development.

## Core Idea

Every delivery system operates within a triangle of relationships:

```
          Product | Service
                 / ^
                /   \
         Value /     \ Delivery
              /       \
             /         \
            /           \
           v             \
      Client <----------> Vendor (Team)
              Engagement
```

Each side of this triangle represents a **relationship line**:

- **Engagement (Client ↔ Vendor):** defines collaboration and trust.
- **Delivery (Vendor ↔ Product):** defines execution and quality.
- **Value (Product ↔ Client):** defines outcomes and impact.

Healthy delivery emerges only when all three sides evolve together.

## Framework Overview

The **3-in-3 SDLC Framework (3SF)** organizes delivery into **eight systemic layers**, each serving a distinct purpose within the client–vendor–product ecosystem.<br/>
Together, these layers form a complete system of alignment, flow, and learning — connecting strategy to execution and collaboration to maturity.

| **#** | **Layer** | **Purpose** |
|:--:|------------|-------------|
| **1** | **3-in-3 Model** | Defines the delivery ecosystem — the relationships between Client, Vendor (Team), and Product / Service through Engagement, Delivery, and Value lines. |
| **2** | **SDLC Stages** | Describes how value flows through seven delivery stages — Discover, Shape, Build, Validate, Release, Run, and Evolve. |
| **3** | **SDLC Practices** | Provide technical, quality, and governance disciplines that sustain flow and reliability across all stages. |
| **4** | **SDLC Stage Dimensions** | Define configurable decision spaces and conditions that determine how each stage operates in context. |
| **5** | **Contextual Drivers Layer (CDL)** | Identify external and internal forces — commercial, organizational, or technical — that shape delivery decisions. |
| **6** | **Stable Rules Layer (SRL)** | Encode universal system rules (R1–R12) that maintain coherence and balance under changing conditions. |
| **7** | **Rule Audit Checklist (RAC)** | Provide a structured method for evaluating delivery health, rule adherence, and improvement priorities. |
| **8** | **Contextual Rules Catalog (CRC)** | Translate the framework into actionable playbooks for specific delivery contexts (e.g., Fixed-Bid, Co-Delivery, Continuous Evolution). |

The **3-in-3 Maturity Layer** overlays the entire framework — describing how **relationship trust and shared responsibility evolve** as the delivery system matures from **Transactional Trust** to **Strategic Partnership** through aligned autonomy, feedback, and learning.

## Evolution

3SF evolved from repeated real-world observations in client-vendor engagements where:

- Projects struggled not because of technical complexity, but due to *mismatched expectations and responsibilities.*
- Vendors assumed clients handled early discovery or sustainment functions, leaving unowned gaps.
- Delivery methodologies (Agile, Waterfall, Hybrid) failed when context and relationships weren’t considered.

The framework emerged as a **unifying model** — connecting strategic, operational, and adaptive layers into one ecosystem of delivery understanding.

## When to Use 3SF

| **Use Case** | **Typical Goal** |
|---------------|------------------|
| **Before a project starts** | Design the right delivery system based on context and commercial model. |
| **During delivery** | Diagnose bottlenecks, misalignments, and maturity gaps using RAC and CRC. |
| **After release** | Guide retrospectives, learning, and relationship improvement across projects. |
| **For leadership development** | Train Delivery Leaders to think systemically and lead through context, not process. |

## Benefits

- **Clarity:** Shared language across client, vendor, and leadership levels.
- **Alignment:** Connected view of strategy, delivery, and value realization.
- **Predictability:** Systematic handling of uncertainty and governance.
- **Learning:** Built-in reflection loops to prevent repeated failures.
- **Scalability:** Applicable to individual projects or portfolios.

## Reading Structure

The theory section introduces 3SF from **philosophy to application**:

1. **Vision, Principles, Beliefs** → Why the framework exists.
2. **3-in-3 Model & Maturity** → Core relationship foundation.
3. **SDLC Model** → Phases and practices.
4. **Stage Dimensions** → How each stage is configured.
5. **Contextual Drivers Layer (CDL)** → What shapes delivery decisions.
6. **Stable Rules Layer (SRL)** → Universal rules of systemic integrity.
7. **Rule Audit Checklist (RAC)** → Diagnostic and assessment method.
8. **Contextual Rules Catalog (CRC)** → Practical playbooks for different contexts.
9. **Relationship Maturity Extension** → Integration of partnership growth into SDLC.

## Summary

> **3SF connects technical delivery with relationship maturity — aligning structure, behavior, and learning into a single, living system.**

It is not a new methodology; it is a **meta-framework** that ensures any methodology fits its context and grows trust between organizations.
