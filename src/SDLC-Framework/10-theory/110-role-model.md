# Role Model

## Purpose

The 3-in-3 SDLC Framework (3SF) defines a system of relationships, practices, and diagnostics that can be applied by many different organizations.<br/>
To apply it effectively, every organization must translate *who* acts on each layer of the framework.<br/>
The **Role Model** provides a universal structure for defining, comparing, and evolving roles — without prescribing job titles or duplicating existing models such as **Team Topologies** or **Org Topologies**.

## 1. Concept Overview

**Roles** in 3SF are defined not by hierarchy or title, but by their **systemic function** within the delivery ecosystem.

Each role is described through three structural perspectives:

| Concept | Question | Description |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Domain** | Where does the role operate? | The main system(s) of responsibility within 3SF. |
| **Dimension** | What does the role manage? | The levers through which it drives maturity and performance. |
| **Interface** | How does the role interact? | The boundaries and relationships it maintains with other actors. |

These three elements form the 3SF **Role System**, allowing any organization to map its own roles consistently.

## 2. Domains – *Where the Role Operates*

Each domain corresponds to one of the three 3SF model spaces.

| Domain | Source Model | Primary Question | Typical Focus |
|---------|---------------|------------------|----------------|
| **Relationship Domain** | 3-in-3 Model & Maturity | How do we build and maintain trust and alignment across Client–Vendor–Product? | Engagement setup, communication, expectation management |
| **Lifecycle Domain** | SDLC Stages & Maturity | How do we ensure flow across stages (Discover → Evolve)? | Planning, cadence, delivery continuity |
| **Practice Domain** | SDLC Practices & Maturity | How do we ensure disciplines work coherently and predictably? | Governance, architecture, delivery enablement |

A single role may operate within one or several domains depending on its scope.

## 3. Dimensions – *What the Role Manages*

Dimensions represent the systemic levers available to all roles.

| Dimension | Definition | Examples of Role Behavior |
|------------|-------------|----------------------------|
| **Flow** | Managing time, cadence, and work in progress | Planning iterations, controlling dependencies |
| **Value** | Translating output into measurable outcome | Prioritization, feedback from users |
| **Quality** | Ensuring fitness for purpose | Reviews, testing, validation gates |
| **Trust** | Building reliability and transparency | Shared commitments, escalation prevention |
| **Learning** | Embedding improvement and knowledge loops | Post-delivery insights, RAC/CRC facilitation |

Each dimension has observable behaviors that can be measured through 3SF diagnostics.

## 4. Interfaces – *How the Role Connects*

Interfaces describe how domains interact through relationships.<br/>
They mirror 3-in-3 relationship lines (Engagement, Delivery, Value) and internal coordination mechanisms.

| Interface Type | Primary Function | Example in Practice |
|----------------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Engagement Interface** | Aligning Client ↔ Vendor expectations | Scope and commitment negotiation |
| **Delivery Interface** | Coordinating Vendor ↔ Product execution | Sprint or release cadence, delivery governance |
| **Value Interface** | Closing Product ↔ Client feedback loop | Outcome validation, business metrics review |
| **Internal Enablement Interface** | Connecting projects with practices | Coaching, standards, automation |
| **Portfolio Interface** | Managing multi-project coordination | Capacity, risk, maturity trends |

A mature role operates across multiple interfaces and sustains information flow between them.

## 5. Applying the Role Model

1. **Identify** in which domains the role operates.
2. **Select** the dimensions it manages.
3. **Map** the interfaces it maintains.
4. **Evaluate** observable behaviors and maturity for each element.

Example:

> *Delivery Lead*<br/>
> Operates in Relationship + Lifecycle + Practice domains;<br/>
> Manages Flow, Quality, and Trust dimensions;<br/>
> Bridges Engagement and Delivery interfaces.

## 6. Relationship with Other Models

The Role Model complements, not replaces:

- **Team Topologies:** focuses on *team structure and interaction modes*.
- **Org Topologies:** focuses on *organizational design archetypes*.
- **3SF Role Model:** focuses on *systemic contribution of each role* to delivery and relationship maturity.

## 7. Practical Use

The Role Model is the foundation for:

- Role-based training and competency frameworks.
- Role alignment during RAC/CRC diagnostics.
- Identifying organizational role gaps and overlaps.
- Evolving delivery structures toward higher maturity.

## Summary

The 3SF Role Model defines how *people and systems* connect the theoretical layers of 3SF with real delivery behavior.<br/>
It turns abstract framework logic into observable, assessable, and improvable practice.
