# 3-in-3 SDLC Maturity Model

## Purpose

The **3-in-3 SDLC Maturity Model** (3SF Maturity Model) expands the original *3-in-3 Relationship Maturity* concept into the **delivery system level**.<br/>
It evaluates how client and vendor maturity expresses itself *through the execution of SDLC stages and practices* — showing how delivery performance and partnership evolution become one continuous system.

This model belongs entirely to the **3-in-3 SDLC Framework**, serving as both:

- a **diagnostic view** — assessing where a project stands in terms of alignment, flow, and learning;
- and a **development path** — describing what maturity looks like when a delivery system operates as a coherent partnership.

## Core Idea

Relationship maturity is reflected not only in how teams collaborate but also **in how the SDLC behaves as a system**:

| **System Dimension** | **Definition** | **Observable Through** |
|-----------------------|----------------|-------------------------|
| **Structural Maturity** | Clarity of process, governance, and responsibility. | SDLC stages, rules, and decision checkpoints. |
| **Operational Maturity** | Effectiveness of practices and feedback loops in maintaining flow. | Engineering, QA, DevOps, and delivery execution. |
| **Relational Maturity** | Quality of collaboration, trust, and shared ownership. | Transparency, communication, and joint learning. |

Mature delivery systems balance all three dimensions. When one lags, the system becomes reactive — regardless of technical proficiency.

## SDLC Stage Maturity Progression

The model integrates the 3-in-3 relationship curve into the seven SDLC stages — describing how each stage enables the partnership to advance from *Transactional* to *Strategic Partnership* through shared responsibility.

| **SDLC Stage** | **Stage Purpose** | **Minimum → Target Maturity** | **Client Role** | **Vendor / Team Role** | **Shared Focus** |
|----------------|-------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------|------------------------|------------------|
| **Discover** | Understand the problem, align on goals, explore solution directions. | Transactional → Aligned Autonomy | Provides context, goals, and stakeholder access. | Facilitates discovery workshops, defines problem space, validates insights. | Shared understanding of goals, assumptions, and constraints. |
| **Shape** | Define product scope, architecture vision, and delivery feasibility. | Aligned Autonomy → Shared Ownership | Frames outcomes and priorities. | Co-creates solution architecture, estimates feasibility, defines delivery model. | Outcome-based planning and governance clarity. |
| **Build** | Design, develop, and integrate components with automation and quality at the core. | Shared Ownership → Strategic Partnership | Owns vision and validates increments. | Delivers autonomously with transparency and technical excellence. | Continuous feedback, visibility, and trust in progress. |
| **Validate** | Test functionality, performance, usability, and security. | Shared Ownership → Strategic Partnership | Participates in acceptance testing and user validation. | Integrates quality and measurement practices. | Mutual accountability for outcomes and experience. |
| **Release** | Package, approve, and deploy through reliable pipelines. | Strategic Partnership (sustained) | Approves and communicates business impact. | Operates reliable CI/CD and rollout procedures. | Shared decision on readiness and release timing. |
| **Run** | Monitor and support the live system. | Strategic Partnership → Aligned Renewal | Defines SLAs and improvement goals. | Manages operations and transparency. | Joint visibility of system health and user experience. |
| **Evolve** | Learn from outcomes and feedback to improve product, process, and team effectiveness. | Aligned Renewal → Strategic Partnership | Sponsors roadmap and innovation. | Leads improvement cycles, proposes experiments. | Continuous learning, data-driven value refinement. |

At higher maturity, SDLC performance becomes **a proxy for relationship health** — smooth flow and transparent delivery indicate trust and alignment.

## Practice-Driven Maturity

Each of the six SDLC Practices contributes to maturity through a specific partnership behavior.

| **Practice** | **Systemic Impact** | **Relationship Expression** |
|---------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Product Thinking** | Aligns vision, goals, and measurable outcomes. | Shared understanding of value and user needs. |
| **Architecture & Design** | Creates transparency in decisions and trade-offs. | Builds trust through clarity and rationale. |
| **Engineering & Quality** | Demonstrates reliability and craftsmanship. | Earns autonomy through consistent excellence. |
| **DevOps & Delivery** | Provides predictability and shared visibility. | Enables trust in team independence. |
| **Governance & Risk** | Establishes decision clarity and accountability. | Prevents blame loops; replaces control with transparency. |
| **Feedback & Learning** | Closes loops between delivery and value. | Turns insights into partnership growth. |

Together, these practices ensure that **technical consistency drives relational consistency**.

## Maturity Levels Across the System

The 3SF SDLC Maturity Model uses four broad levels of delivery maturity — applied to the full SDLC or individual stages.

| **Level** | **Name** | **System Characteristics** | **Collaboration Behavior** |
|------------|-----------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **1. Controlled Execution** | Reactive and rule-bound. Processes exist but are applied rigidly; success depends on individuals. | Client controls; vendor executes. Communication transactional and status-based. |
| **2. Coordinated Flow** | Process repeatable and partly adaptive. Feedback loops appear, but learning not yet systematic. | Client and vendor coordinate. Transparency increases, autonomy conditional. |
| **3. Empowered Delivery** | Delivery system self-regulating; quality and risk controlled by teams. | Teams own execution; governance focuses on outcomes. Collaboration proactive. |
| **4. Adaptive Partnership** | System continuously learns and adapts; governance and delivery fully integrated. | Client and vendor co-own outcomes, plan jointly, and innovate together. |

The maturity of a given engagement can differ across stages — e.g., *Build* may operate at Level 3 while *Run* still behaves at Level 2.

## Assessing SDLC Maturity

Projects can assess maturity by combining **RAC** (Rule Audit Checklist) insights with a **relationship-maturity pulse** based on collaboration behavior.<br/>
Each rule in RAC (R1–R12) can be extended with a relational dimension:

- **Structural alignment:** Is there clarity of ownership and decision boundaries?
- **Operational integrity:** Are practices consistent and transparent?
- **Learning continuity:** Are feedback loops closed and acted upon jointly?

A simple self-assessment uses a 1–4 scale mapped to the four maturity levels above, producing a visual radar for:

- Delivery System Health (flow, automation, quality)
- Relationship Health (trust, alignment, joint learning)

## How to Use the Model

| **Use Case** | **How to Apply** |
|---------------|------------------|
| **Project Diagnostics** | Combine RAC results and practice review to determine current SDLC maturity per stage. |
| **Leadership Reflection** | Evaluate how governance behaviors support or hinder maturity progression. |
| **Training Planning** | Identify capability gaps per practice to design targeted upskilling. |
| **Contract or Engagement Review** | Use maturity trajectory to adjust governance, communication, and autonomy agreements. |

## Relationship Between the Two Maturity Models

| **Model** | **Focus** | **Output** | **Usage Context** |
|------------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **3-in-3 Maturity Model** | Human and organizational dynamics between Client, Vendor, and Product. | Measures trust, autonomy, and shared responsibility. | Used independently or as input for early engagement reflection. |
| **3-in-3 SDLC Maturity Model (3SF)** | Systemic performance of delivery and learning loops inside the 3-in-3 ecosystem. | Measures delivery integrity, governance clarity, and feedback maturity. | Embedded in 3SF for ongoing health assessment and improvement planning. |

The first model explains *how relationships mature*.<br/>
The second explains *how those mature relationships manifest in delivery systems.*

## Summary

The **3-in-3 SDLC Maturity Model** transforms abstract relationship dynamics into **observable delivery behaviors**.<br/>
It connects relationship trust with technical and operational excellence — demonstrating that sustainable delivery maturity is not achieved through process control alone, but through **shared responsibility, transparency, and continuous learning**.
