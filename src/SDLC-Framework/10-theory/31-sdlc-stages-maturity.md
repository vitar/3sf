# SDLC Stages Maturity

## Purpose

The **SDLC Stages Maturity** model describes how delivery systems evolve in capability, alignment, and learning across the seven SDLC stages.<br/>
It reflects how a project grows from *controlled execution* to *adaptive partnership* — connecting delivery performance to relationship trust.

Each SDLC stage not only defines what to do but also how **maturely** it can be done:

- **Structurally**, by having clarity and consistency.
- **Operationally**, by enabling flow and feedback.
- **Relationally**, by building trust and shared responsibility.

## Maturity Levels Across the SDLC

| **Level** | **Name** | **System Characteristics** | **Collaboration Behavior** |
|------------|-----------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **1. Controlled Execution** | Reactive and rule-bound. Processes exist but are applied rigidly; success depends on individuals. | Client controls; vendor executes. Communication transactional and status-based. |
| **2. Coordinated Flow** | Processes repeatable and partly adaptive. Feedback loops appear, but learning not yet systematic. | Client and vendor coordinate. Transparency increases, autonomy conditional. |
| **3. Empowered Delivery** | Delivery system self-regulating; quality and risk controlled by teams. | Teams own execution; governance focuses on outcomes. Collaboration proactive. |
| **4. Adaptive Partnership** | System continuously learns and adapts; governance and delivery fully integrated. | Client and vendor co-own outcomes, plan jointly, and innovate together. |

Each stage can operate at a different maturity level — for example, *Build* may perform at Level 3 while *Evolve* remains at Level 2.<br/>
The goal is not uniform maturity, but **balance** between flow, governance, and relationship depth.

## SDLC Stage Maturity Map

| **SDLC Stage** | **Stage Purpose** | **Minimum → Target Maturity** | **Client Role** | **Vendor / Team Role** | **Shared Focus** |
|----------------|-------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------|------------------------|------------------|
| **Discover** | Understand the problem, align on goals, explore solution directions. | Transactional → Aligned Autonomy | Provides context, goals, and stakeholder access. | Facilitates discovery workshops, defines problem space, validates insights. | Shared understanding of goals, assumptions, and constraints. |
| **Shape** | Define product scope, architecture vision, and delivery feasibility. | Aligned Autonomy → Shared Ownership | Frames outcomes and priorities. | Co-creates solution architecture, estimates feasibility, defines delivery model. | Outcome-based planning and governance clarity. |
| **Build** | Design, develop, and integrate components with automation and quality at the core. | Shared Ownership → Strategic Partnership | Owns vision and validates increments. | Delivers autonomously with transparency and technical excellence. | Continuous feedback, visibility, and trust in progress. |
| **Validate** | Test functionality, performance, usability, and security. | Shared Ownership → Strategic Partnership | Participates in acceptance testing and user validation. | Integrates quality and measurement practices. | Mutual accountability for outcomes and experience. |
| **Release** | Package, approve, and deploy through reliable pipelines. | Strategic Partnership (sustained) | Approves and communicates business impact. | Operates reliable CI/CD and rollout procedures. | Shared decision on readiness and release timing. |
| **Run** | Monitor and support the live system. | Strategic Partnership → Aligned Renewal | Defines SLAs and improvement goals. | Manages operations and transparency. | Joint visibility of system health and user experience. |
| **Evolve** | Learn from outcomes and feedback to improve product, process, and team effectiveness. | Aligned Renewal → Strategic Partnership | Sponsors roadmap and innovation. | Leads improvement cycles, proposes experiments. | Continuous learning, data-driven value refinement. |

Maturity across the SDLC reflects **how well flow, accountability, and learning are synchronized**.<br/>
Gaps between stages reveal where governance or communication must adapt.

## Structural, Operational, and Relational Dimensions

| **Dimension** | **Definition** | **Observable Indicators** |
|----------------|----------------|----------------------------|
| **Structural Maturity** | Clarity of process, ownership, and decision boundaries. | Roles and responsibilities are defined, governance cadence is predictable. |
| **Operational Maturity** | Effectiveness of practices and flow in maintaining stability and quality. | Stable velocity, working automation, consistent delivery predictability. |
| **Relational Maturity** | Quality of collaboration and transparency between Client and Vendor. | Trust indicators, open communication, joint problem-solving behaviors. |

The **Structural** dimension establishes order,<br/>
the **Operational** dimension sustains flow,<br/>
and the **Relational** dimension drives long-term value.

## Assessing SDLC Stage Maturity

Maturity can be assessed per stage or holistically through:

- **RAC (Rule Audit Checklist):** Structural and operational rule compliance.
- **Feedback Indicators:** Lead time, quality metrics, risk signals.
- **Relationship Health:** Trust and alignment feedback between Client and Vendor.

Each stage’s maturity score feeds into a *delivery health profile* that highlights which capabilities enable or block overall system flow.

## Summary

- SDLC Stages Maturity connects **delivery quality** with **relationship growth**.
- Each stage advances from controlled execution to adaptive partnership.
- Balance across structural, operational, and relational dimensions ensures the system remains stable and learning-driven.
- Maturity is not about perfection — it’s about **adaptive coherence**: the ability to stay aligned while continuously improving.
