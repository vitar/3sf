# 3-in-3 Model Maturity

## Shared Responsibility & Relationship Maturity

Client and Vendor maturity grow **together** through progressive collaboration and shared ownership of decisions.<br/>
This maturity expresses how responsibility, trust, and autonomy evolve between both sides.

| **Maturity Level** | **Client Focus** | **Team Focus** | **Shared Responsibility** |
|---------------------|------------------|----------------|---------------------------|
| **Transactional Trust** | Provides requirements and approvals. | Acts as **Trusted Executor** — follows plan, ensures quality within scope. | Defined by contracts and control; limited feedback. |
| **Aligned Autonomy** | Frames outcomes, clarifies success measures. | Becomes **Autonomous in Execution** — self-manages within agreed direction. | Alignment grows through transparency and predictable delivery. |
| **Shared Ownership** | Owns vision and intent, participates in decision shaping. | **Owns Shaping and Execution** — proposes options and trade-offs. | Decisions become co-created; priorities discussed openly. |
| **Strategic Partnership** | Entrusts business risk and direction. | **Co-defines and Co-navigates Path** — contributes to vision and strategy. | Full partnership; joint accountability for outcomes and value. |

Progression along this curve is gradual and reversible — it must be *earned* through reliability, openness, and continuous feedback.

## Assessing Relationship Maturity

In 3SF, relationship maturity is measured not by duration but by **quality of collaboration** across three relationship lines:

1. **Engagement (Client + Vendor):** Trust, transparency, and clarity of collaboration.
2. **Delivery (Team + Delivery):** Capability, agility, and self-management in achieving goals.
3. **Value (Product + Client):** Alignment of product outcomes with real business impact.

Each can be evaluated as:

- **Reactive → Managed → Proactive**, or
- **Transactional → Aligned Autonomy → Strategic Partnership**, depending on project depth.

Tools such as the *3-in-3 Maturity Self-Assessment* help teams reflect on their current and target levels in each dimension.

## Why Relationship Maturity Matters

Traditional SDLC frameworks assume delivery success depends solely on process quality.<br/>
In client–vendor environments, **relationship quality is equally structural.**

A technically correct system can still fail when:

- Governance is one-sided or unclear.
- Communication is filtered or delayed.
- Outcomes are validated separately by each side.

3SF closes this gap by embedding **dual accountability** and **shared responsibility** — ensuring that both client and vendor evolve together toward aligned autonomy and partnership.

## Summary

The **Relationship Maturity Model** represents *how the system grows* —<br/>
a trajectory from **Transactional** to **Strategic Partnership**, embedded in how collaboration, trust, and shared ownership evolve over time.

Together, they make the 3-in-3 ecosystem a **living model of partnership evolution**, ensuring that as the product matures, so does the relationship that builds it.
