# SDLC Model

## Overview

The **3SF SDLC Model** defines the complete flow of software product delivery as a **continuous system of understanding, creation, validation, and improvement**.<br/>
It describes *how value moves through the system* — from the first discovery of a problem to the ongoing evolution of the solution.

Each stage represents a distinct purpose but is connected through feedback loops, ensuring that learning never stops and that every delivery cycle strengthens both product and partnership maturity.

## The Seven SDLC Stages

| **Stage** | **Purpose** | **Outcome** |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Discover** | Understand the problem, align on goals, and explore solution directions with stakeholders. | A validated understanding of the problem space and desired outcomes. |
| **Shape** | Define the product scope, architecture vision, and delivery feasibility based on real constraints. | A feasible and outcome-aligned delivery plan with known assumptions and trade-offs. |
| **Build** | Design, develop, and integrate software components with automation and quality at the core. | A working, testable product increment that demonstrates tangible progress and reliability. |
| **Validate** | Test functionality, performance, usability, and security to ensure the solution meets expectations. | Verified confidence that the product delivers the intended experience and quality. |
| **Release** | Package, approve, and deploy the solution for users through reliable and repeatable pipelines. | A stable release available to users with traceable approvals and predictable deployment. |
| **Run** | Monitor and support the live system, ensuring reliability, scalability, and fast issue resolution. | Reliable operations, user satisfaction, and data-driven visibility of system health. |
| **Evolve** | Learn from outcomes and feedback to continuously improve product, process, and team effectiveness. | Actionable insights leading to better products, stronger relationships, and organizational learning. |

## SDLC as a System of Flow and Learning

The stages are **not sequential checkpoints** — they form an *adaptive flow* of intent, delivery, and feedback:

`Discover → Shape → Build → Validate → Release → Run → Evolve ↺`

- **Discover & Shape** establish clarity and feasibility before significant investment.
- **Build, Validate, and Release** create and deliver tangible value.
- **Run & Evolve** close the learning loop, informing future discovery.

Each iteration through the loop increases **delivery maturity** and **relationship trust** — evolving both the system and the collaboration that sustains it.

## SDLC Practices

The 3SF SDLC is supported by six **cross-cutting practices**.<br/>
Each practice is active in all stages but expresses different intensity and focus depending on the phase.

| **Practice** | **Definition** | **Core Focus** |
|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Product Thinking** | We co-create clarity and direction with clients by defining goals, value, and outcomes before committing to delivery. | Shared understanding of *why* we build. |
| **Architecture & Design** | We shape scalable, secure, and adaptable solutions by aligning technical design with product intent and constraints. | Fit-for-purpose design and feasibility. |
| **Engineering & Quality** | We build maintainable, high-quality software through craftsmanship, automation, and shared responsibility. | Consistency, reliability, and craftsmanship. |
| **DevOps & Delivery** | We enable fast, safe, and repeatable delivery by integrating automation, environments, and monitoring from day one. | Speed and stability through automation and visibility. |
| **Governance & Risk** | We manage complexity and protect value by embedding compliance, security, and accountability into every step. | Transparency, predictability, and responsibility. |
| **Feedback & Learning** | We continuously improve by listening to signals from users, systems, and teams — turning insight into better outcomes. | Growth, reflection, and adaptability. |

## SDLC Stage × Practice Matrix

| **Stage →** | **Discover** | **Shape** | **Build** | **Validate** | **Release** | **Run** | **Evolve** |
|--------------|--------------|------------|------------|---------------|--------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Product Thinking** | Define goals, outcomes, and user needs. | Align scope and priorities with value. | Keep user outcomes visible during development. | Validate value and user satisfaction. | Communicate impact to stakeholders. | Monitor usage and adoption. | Reframe new opportunities from insights. |
| **Architecture & Design** | Explore high-level approaches and constraints. | Define architecture vision and feasibility. | Implement design patterns and integrations. | Validate non-functional requirements. | Harden deployment architecture. | Ensure scalability and reliability. | Modernize design and tech stack. |
| **Engineering & Quality** | Evaluate technical feasibility and risks. | Prepare environments, automation, and QA strategy. | Build with test coverage and code quality. | Run functional, performance, and security tests. | Stabilize codebase and fix regressions. | Handle incidents, maintain performance. | Improve maintainability and refactor for growth. |
| **DevOps & Delivery** | Define automation vision and environment needs. | Configure pipelines, versioning, and CI/CD baselines. | Automate build and integration flows. | Integrate automated testing and staging. | Execute deployments and rollback procedures. | Monitor infrastructure and uptime. | Evolve CI/CD and observability tools. |
| **Governance & Risk** | Define governance model and decision cadence. | Validate feasibility against budget, compliance, and timeline. | Track progress, dependencies, and scope change. | Ensure acceptance and compliance sign-offs. | Control release approvals and audits. | Manage SLA, access, and operational risks. | Integrate governance learnings into future planning. |
| **Feedback & Learning** | Capture assumptions and unknowns. | Validate feasibility and stakeholder feedback. | Collect dev and QA metrics for improvement. | Measure outcomes and quality signals. | Gather user feedback post-release. | Analyze incidents and usage data. | Integrate feedback into discovery and training. |

This matrix ensures every stage has the right practices active — avoiding the “handover gaps” where context or responsibility gets lost between phases.

## Relationship-Aware SDLC

In **3SF**, each SDLC stage also represents a **relationship checkpoint** between Client and Vendor — defining *how shared responsibility matures* as delivery progresses.

| **Stage** | **Relationship Focus** | **Shared Ownership Example** |
|------------|------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Discover** | Transparency and alignment on problem space. | Joint definition of goals, assumptions, and success criteria. |
| **Shape** | Trust and outcome-based planning. | Co-design of roadmap, architecture, and estimation. |
| **Build** | Autonomy and visibility in execution. | Shared sprint reviews and delivery metrics. |
| **Validate** | Confidence and mutual accountability. | Joint acceptance and performance evaluation. |
| **Release** | Predictable and transparent delivery. | Shared approval and communication to users. |
| **Run** | Stability and operational trust. | Shared monitoring dashboards and escalation paths. |
| **Evolve** | Partnership and learning continuity. | Joint retrospectives and improvement backlogs. |

Relationship maturity increases naturally as both organizations learn to rely on one another for clarity, delivery, and learning — turning the SDLC into a **partnership growth mechanism**, not just a technical lifecycle.

## Flow Characteristics Across the SDLC

| **Characteristic** | **Early Phases (Discover–Shape)** | **Middle Phases (Build–Validate–Release)** | **Late Phases (Run–Evolve)** |
|---------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Focus** | Alignment and feasibility | Execution and verification | Continuity and learning |
| **Feedback Loops** | Qualitative (people, intent) | Quantitative (metrics, performance) | Systemic (value, outcome) |
| **Risk Profile** | High uncertainty | Managed risk | Controlled adaptation |
| **Leadership Mode** | Facilitative and consultative | Operational and technical | Strategic and reflective |
| **Ownership Distribution** | Client-driven collaboration | Vendor-led autonomy | Shared strategic renewal |

## Using the SDLC Model

The SDLC model is **a map, not a prescription**.<br/>
Each project can emphasize different stages depending on context — for example:

- In R&D or early product discovery, *Discover* and *Shape* dominate.
- In modernization or migration work, *Build*, *Validate*, and *Release* take the lead.
- In product sustainment, *Run* and *Evolve* become the main engines of improvement.

3SF’s value lies in how it enables **conscious adaptation** — choosing *how deep each stage goes* based on commercial, organizational, and technical realities.

## Summary

- The SDLC Model defines **how value flows** through seven interconnected stages.
- Six **cross-cutting practices** sustain quality, predictability, and learning.
- Each stage contributes both to **delivery outcomes** and **relationship maturity**.
- 3SF turns the SDLC into a **system of alignment, flow, and feedback** — ensuring that what we build is valuable, feasible, and continuously improving.
