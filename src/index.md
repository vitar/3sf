# 3SF Quick Start – From Context to Practice

> *“3SF is not another delivery method — it’s the operating system that connects them all.”*

## What Is 3SF

The **3-in-3 SDLC Framework (3SF)** is a **relationship-aware delivery system** that unites **Client**, **Vendor**, and **Product / Service** into one coherent ecosystem.

Where most frameworks describe *how teams deliver*, 3SF explains **how organizations align** — showing how engagement, delivery, and value form an integrated system of trust and flow.

3SF is built on the theoretical foundation of the **Human Cooperation System (HCS)** — a diagnostic system that defines the 25 stable functions required for sustainable cooperation.<br/>
While HCS explains *how* cooperation works at a systemic level, 3SF applies these principles to software delivery ecosystems, transforming theory into actionable governance and measurable value.

At its core lies a simple triangle:

```
                     Product | Service
                            / ^
                           /   \
                    Value /     \ Delivery
                         /       \
                        /         \
                       /           \
                      v             \
      Client (Business) <----------> Vendor (Engineering)
                         Engagement
```

!!! note "Scope of the Client–Vendor Relationship"

    The 3SF model defines “Client” and “Vendor” as systemic roles, not organizational labels.

    - In multi-organization engagements, they represent separate entities.
    - In single-organization environments, they correspond to internal systems of accountability — for example, Business (Client) and Engineering (Vendor).

    This universality allows 3SF to govern any relationship where value is created through delivery.

Each side of this triangle represents a **relationship line**:

- **Engagement** — how Client and Vendor collaborate.
- **Delivery** — how Vendor and Product interact to produce outcomes.
- **Value** — how Product results satisfy Client goals.

When all three sides evolve together, delivery becomes aligned, predictable, and continuously learning.

## 3SF Compact Core – The 3×3 System

**3SF** is built around a *shareable core* called **The Systemic Contract** — the operating logic that turns **Trust** and **Context** into measurable results.

```
          The System (Pillars)
          /         |         \
      Client     Vendor     Product
          \         |         /
        The Mindset (Principles)
       [Context] [Trust] [Outcome]
             ↓      ↓      ↓
          The Action (Contracts)
          [ECC] [Boundary] [OAM]
```

| Layer | Focus | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The System (3 Pillars)** | *Client – Vendor – Product* | Defines **what** the framework unites. |
| **The Mindset (3 Principles)** | *Context – Trust – Outcome* | Defines **why** the framework works. |
| **The Action (3 Contracts)** | *Grounding – Boundary – Value* | Defines **how** the framework delivers results. |

→ These nine elements form the *Systemic Contract* that governs every 3SF engagement — from vision to measurable value.

## 3SF User Onboarding Checklist

> *Start here before using any tools or methods.*

| Step | Action | Why This Step Is Necessary |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Orient** | Read the [**Vision, Principles & Beliefs**](100-theory/105-vision-principles-beliefs.md) to align mindset. | This is the cultural DNA. Without shared principles, tools cannot create alignment. |
| **2. Identify** | Find your **Composite Functional Role** in the [**Role Responsibility Snapshot**](000-intro/020-role-snapshot.md). | Defines your accountability within the joint system — who you co-own outcomes with. |
| **3. Ground** | Complete the [**Engagement Context Canvas (ECC)**](200-practice/205-engagement-context-canvas.md). | Enforces **Context before Method** — defines the system’s environment and constraints. |
| **4. Govern** | Co-sign the [**Autonomy & Control Boundary Charter**](200-practice/210-autonomy-control-charter.md). | Establishes **Trust before Control** — formalizes decision rights and escalation paths. |
| **5. Measure** | Set up the [**Maturity Dashboard**](200-practice/215-maturity-dashboard.md). | Ensures transparency and shared understanding of relationship health. |
| **6. Reference** | Review the **[Glossary](500-reference/520-glossary.md) & [Acronyms](500-reference/510-acronyms.md)** to clarify terminology. | Ensures shared understanding of all 3SF terms, contracts, and maturity metrics. |

Once these steps are done, the 3SF Operating System is **initialized**.<br/>
You can then safely apply any methodology — Agile, Lean, or hybrid — within a coherent relational context.

## Why 3SF Exists

3SF emerged from real-world experience across hundreds of projects where success or failure was rarely technical.<br/>
It almost always came down to **misaligned expectations, responsibilities, and maturity** between Client and Vendor teams.

3SF was designed to fix that by:

- Making **relationships inspectable and measurable**.
- Providing **shared tools** that connect strategy to execution.
- Replacing blame with **systemic learning**.
- Turning transactional projects into **strategic partnerships**.

## How to Navigate 3SF

The framework is structured like an **operating system**:

| Layer | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| [**Theory (OS)**](100-theory/100-intro-purpose.md) | Explains *why* 3SF exists and *how* it structures relationships. |
| [**Practice (Apps)**](200-practice/200-practice-architecture.md) | Shows *how* to use 3SF tools in real projects. |
| [**Governance & Diagnostics**](300-contracts/300-contracts-architecture.md) | Defines how principles and agreements evolve into measurable maturity. |
| [**Reference**](500-reference/510-acronyms.md) | Central library of terms, acronyms, sources, and licensing for cross-framework consistency. |

Each section builds on the previous one — but you don’t need to read it linearly.<br/>
